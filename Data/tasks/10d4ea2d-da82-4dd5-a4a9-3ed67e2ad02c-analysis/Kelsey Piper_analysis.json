    "user": "Please analyze these tweets from @Kelsey Piper and provide a summary of what they mainly talked about in the past week:\n\n@firasd the defense is that in the wholesome old days we got by without all of these fancy crops from the tropics. it's a favorite degrowth talking point.\n\ndegrowth conservatives, like degrowth leftists, make staples unaffordable and then romanticize poverty to try to convince you that this is cool and good actually\n\nTrump really does on an instinctive level feel that the President of the United States should wield absolute power and be illegal to criticize.\n\nCGDev attempts to dive in to which programs have been hit by the USAID cancellations, which includes many of the most cost-effective life-saving programs: https://t.co/HGmy79PH2p\n\n@JeremiahDJohns yeah exactly. I don't think he should have shut down but I think he managed to get the worst of several worlds. some credit is due for having been on the right side of the Biden issue, but this was not brilliant play from a bad position, it was backing into one.\n\n@JeremiahDJohns and it's not like he was in a bad spot by complete coincidence, Dems didn't have a clear strategy or message for the CR even as it became clearer it wasn't clean\n\n@AltHistoryFan I don't know if I agree on a tactical level about whether it'd have been possible to get this demand but I agree that Musk is doing a huge amount of damage (and going in I thought he might be a moderating influence!)\n\n@BenShindel 'in a freefall' seems too strong for the polls right now. I think people who already hated Trump are even more unimpressed but there haven't been all that many observable converts. maybe it's coming.\n\n@WatsonLadd yep. And the Democrats clearly flirted with this as a message but weren't willing to draw it as a line, which I think gets you none of the benefits (you just look unserious)\n\n@BenShindel that is an interesting take. you don't buy the polling saying voters would emphatically blame republicans for a shutdown?\n\n'we won't vote for a CR that cuts veteran's care at Elon Musk's discretion' is a perfectly good place to draw the line, but ideally you draw that line well in advance so if the Republicans force a shutdown over it you've been saying the same thing all along.\n\nShutdowns are extremely bad, and there's a pretty good political argument for letting the Republican party destroy the economy and get voted out. But I think the ideal thing would have been to make it clear where the line was two weeks ago and follow through.\n\n@BenShindel Slotkin was ready to FB!\n\n@sassermac99706 I've had enough self-fulfilling defeatism. I think that there are a lot of us and we can change things.\n\n@admcrlsn daylight dems\n\n@sassermac99706 have you considered that instead we could try being loud about our own values instead of passively hoping the right thing happens by coincidence?\n\n@BenShindel I think there was a case for not filibustering here (and a stronger case for making a very narrow demand) but not much of a case for the degree of messaging mess\n\n@sassermac99706 I think that the attitude of 'shut up and trust the grownups' has failed catastrophically with Biden's administration and there will be a lot of fighting in the aftermath but I'd rather have the fighting than be lied to.\n\n@sassermac99706 I think that the future of the Democratic party is up for grabs and everyone who cares about it should be trying to make their case\n\n@BenShindel he mishandled the question of whether to shut down the government or vote for the bad republican CR, letting a bunch of vulnerable members speak out against it and then announcing the party wouldn't actually block it.\n\nEvery single person who believes that this country deserves a better president than Donald Trump and would have a better president than Donald Trump if the Democratic leadership weren't full of cowards obsessed with their own reputations should be on the same page here. Daylight.\n\nI for one want to thank Joe Biden for picking such an evocative phrase for what the Democrats so badly need right now. Daylight. Lots of it. Daylight between us and Joe Biden, us and Kamala Harris, us and Chuck Schumer, us and the entire party apparatus that failed us.\n\n@robbensinger surely if this is the problem we can hire someone who tweets constantly about how the cops deserve your stuff more than you do?\n\n@FriedCh41287569 @LevineJonathan then they should charge him with a crime, instead they have said this is about his speech\n\n@goblinodds maybe this is what it will take to get democrats on board with repealing it\n\n@clintcarlos so the plan is to violently conquer and disenfranchise 40 million people who would then be taxed without representation. what an evil thing even to threaten/joke about.\n\n@economeager this is the obvious guess but I was curious whether any people who support MAGA say that and if not what they say. mostly a range from 'we're kidding' to 'nah they'll vote Republican' to 'it's worth it for national greatness' to 'territory like puerto rico'. the worst people.\n\n@BlackLabelAdvsr obviously it is a far more evil thing to propose seriously, and would be the utter destruction of America and everything it stands for.\n\n@BlackLabelAdvsr so the plan is to violently conquer and disenfranchise 40 million people who would then be taxed without representation. what an evil thing even to threaten/joke about.\n\n@AxelPlasma they don't, and the lying/trolling about it is childish\n\n@beranes75112 well, a bunch of them are in the mentions defending it apparently seriously, and I think 'don't take Trump seriously' hasn't been doing too well lately\n\n@beranes75112 I mean when Trump is openly declaring that he wants to make Canada the 51st state I don't think we get to whine that it was so mean and unfair of the Canadians to take us seriously and be angry because we were just kidding\n\n@jessesingal they're right about this one\n\n@Virky_Dormit @LevineJonathan yep. they should just have arrested those of the protestors who have committed crimes (quite a few of them) instead of this absurd behavior of explicitly saying they accuse him of no crime\n\n@LevineJonathan I despise Columbia SJP. But I love the US Constitution, due process, and the expectation the government arrests people for crimes, not for vile beliefs.\n\n@PTBwrites in CA we passed a good law (it occasionally happens!) barring municipalities from imposing zoning or permitting requirements on small daycares run out of a residential home, which has done a lot to cut red tape without hitting safety\n\n@bshlgrs @tszzl huh, no I haven't. I'll give that a shot\n\n@PTBwrites I'm all aboard the deregulation train in many industries but I think daycare needs rules. The thing to focus on is making compliance costs low - rules should be uncomplicated, forms should be short, bureaucrats should be helpful.\n\n@tszzl I'm so excited for this. I ask AIs to continue my fiction all the time and they just can't do it. 4.5 is the closest yet but it still feels immature and clumsy\n\nThe US should never engage in territorial conquest; I'd be delighted to add Canadian states if they wanted in, which they obviously don't. But I can't see what Trump is imagining the best case scenario as if he forces the issue.\n\nI'm confused about the 'Canada as 51st state' thing because, if they succeeded, they'd be adding 40million new citizens who overwhelmingly hate Trump and hate MAGA, flipping the House and Senate. Right?\n\n@BewareLeviathan The US spends $26billion a year on treatment for HIV in America. Our successful campaign to crush the virus globally doesn't just cheaply buy us lots of goodwill, it keeps us safer: https://t.co/vIV8LbY5Cz\n\nThis apparently includes the three Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation program terminations I highlighted last week: https://t.co/IQIKjcd0yQ\n\nThe Dispatch has good coverage of the ongoing disruptions to PEPFAR, but also some hopeful news: a few PEPFAR programs sent termination notices have been un-terminated, though still not funded https://t.co/CZ9K0sLL62\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer that misses \"PEPFAR programs were explicitly sent termination notices\", so no I don't think that accurately captures the situation\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer I think it was irresponsible and wrong to send termination notices to PEPFAR programs that serve hundreds of thousands of people and to freeze funding to clinics, shuttering them.\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer I'm genuinely confused about what you think would be a fair headline for an article about how PEPFAR, which saves millions of lives, is currently frozen with clinics closed and many programs sent termination notices, but activists are protesting to try to get this fixed\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer yes!!! it is an article about something that is at risk of happening and why activists are protesting to try to prevent it from happening!!\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer you seem far more outraged that I said a lot of people will die if the clinics remain closed than you are that the clinics remain closed. I think you should be more outraged by the clinics being closed than by people accurately describing the effects it will have.\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer that's not even what the headline says! it says, correctly, that killing PEPFAR means killing millions of people, and then it explains that while waivers have been issued, money is still frozen and programs were terminated and clinics are closed\n\n@lesmothian a play can be a powerful meditation on the rule of law while depicting tyranny and injustice; indeed I would argue it is more powerful for it\n\n@lesmothian sorry, who do you think that the play believes is right? is importantly immortal? is loved and admired? More or Rich? I agree on the events it depicts, but I think you're completely wrong about what it's saying about them.\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer I don't know what you think journalists should do after a solid month of reporting that even though the waivers were issued the clinics aren't open. I promise you, nothing would delight me more than to write \"this is fixed now!\" and I'll write it as soon as I confirm it's true\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer the article specifically acknowledges the fact that there have been waivers and that no one seems to have intended the clinic closures, and says that's precisely why it is unusually valuable to draw attention to them - because they were not intended and so may be easy to fix\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer I have spent the last month contacting State and affected clinics and affected doctors, publishing the program termination notices and trying to inform Rubio that the waivers he put in place aren't working. the piece is about the ongoing efforts of activists to get this fixed\n\n@MyAlteredEgo @libpol_org @philvischer Because when I check in with the orgs that administer PEPFAR they received termination notices!! I hope those have been reversed and have been actively urging state to follow through on its promises\n\n@HanShawnity yes, I don't know why they handled this so clumsily with a dramatic arrest at his home while his visa was still valid instead of following the law which I do think gives them provision to do this\n\n@HanShawnity That's not my understanding, I'll withdraw my complaint if that's what happened. The account I read is that when they went to arrest him, they mistakenly thought he had a student visa. he showed them his valid green card and they arrested him anyway. it hasn't yet been revoked.\n\n@HanShawnity I can't stand the guy but if he committed a crime, he should be charged with that crime, and if there are grounds to revoke the visa they should revoke it. It's not right to have the government come grab him with no charges while his visa's valid.\n\n@MaskettaMale A Man For All Seasons\n\n@orthonormalist then after that visa has been revoked according to the legal processes, they may deport him; but DHS should not be detaining him while he has a current, legal visa that has not been revoked.\n\n@austinc3301 A Man For All Seasons, a beautiful play about conscience, humanism and the rule of law in the leadup to the execution of Sir Thomas More for refusing to endorse Henry VIII's creation of the Church of England\n\n@yonashav @bobabowen @Joost_Huizinga this is by far the most exciting thing I've seen out of OAI this year (and I really like 4.5).\n\nYes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake. https://t.co/RBSzQ42rom\n\n@ByrneHobart this is so obnoxious. do you think the police want to be guarding Tesla dealerships? I'm sure they'd rather be solving other crimes, but people keep violently attacking Tesla dealerships!"
