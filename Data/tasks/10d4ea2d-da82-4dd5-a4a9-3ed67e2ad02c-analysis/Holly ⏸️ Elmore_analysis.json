(From The Sequences-- I assume you're implicating EA/rationality) https://t.co/MyAGabSojb\n\nAfter you've been thru it once, you know in your bones that giving up status and the identity that came w it will not kill you. Please brave this leap of faith and stop contributing to ASI for the good of the world. It is hard, but you will make it, and you will be stronger. 3/\n\nIt's really scary if you've never practiced surrendering status before. Like your first breakup, it can feel like a death. I'm trying to remember this as I ask people to give up status and a piece of their identity by leaving AI companies and their collaborators like OpenPhil. 2/\n\nIn the same way that \"the first cut is the deepest\" with romantic breakups, the first time is the hardest when it comes to giving up status. You learn that you'll survive, and you gain confidence that allows you to act with more integrity in the future. 1/\n\nü§Æ Ugh this reeks of OpenAI PR memo.\n\n\"What are you doing today to prepare for my company, OpenAI, recklessly aiming to destroy your way of life?\"\n\nFixed it.\n\n@MahmetTokarev I agree-- specifically it's a bid to be a Great Man of History or even a god\n\nIf Wall Street's sin is greed, I think the AI world's sin is FOMO.\n\n@David_Kasten Oh I think I interpreted that opposite what you meant\n\n@austinc3301 That is if this story is real\n\n@austinc3301 I feel like it's got to be about fear of defection/brain drain\n\n@lisperati @ShakeelHashim @ESYudkowsky They like libertarians and iconoclasts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n@David_Kasten &gt;My fellows already leave so much on the table trying to placate them and service their egos.\n\nThis behavior, btw, makes it so they have no reason to change their mind. They're exactly where they want to be when we treat them as super important bc of their proximity to AI dev.\n\n@David_Kasten I'm not counting on converting those ppl. My fellows already leave so much on the table trying to placate them and service their egos. Imo a lot of those ppl are only gonna care if AI irresponsibility is actually stigmatized in broader society. They're convincible-- just not yet.\n\n@David_Kasten Honestly, if you think this, we should get as far away from these amoral people as possible and openly oppose them. Terrible allies. \nhttps://t.co/oOCiAIJ1QA\n\n@David_Kasten In this case, Alex is pissed now, but I directly confronted a serious issue (instead of tiptoeing around it politely and allowing him not to take it to heart) and he will probably be reflecting on it. On top of that, people are watching and getting the message.\n\n@David_Kasten 1) Of course everyone's not worth convincing *with your limited energy*. 2) \"Convincing\" someone like Alex w an ingrained take means spending time you can't spend on other people, most of whom are probably more receptive. 3) Negative confrontations also change minds.\n\nIt's true OpenAI is openly evil here whereas Anthropic merely wants to make AI a war asset, but how long before Anthropic drops the act too? Don't be fooled again like so many of you were by Sam Altman-- it's obvious where all the frontier AI companies are headed.\n\n@David_Kasten Not really worth holding on to such people, is it?\n\n@David_Kasten Are you saying he'll convince himself he doesn't care if I tell him that's his revealed preference?\n\nDon't do this.\n\n@lxrjl I know you live in a web of tortured justifications for supporting a supervillain megaproject, but straightforwardly you are supporting the building of a doomsday device.\n\n@lxrjl That's what your actions and priorities imply, yeah\n\nYou can't support Anthropic building bigger and bigger models (who have God knows what interior experience), putting the entire world at risk, and then act all offended that some bad apple would treat a model cruelly, as if that's what wrong with AI development.\n\nDon't get me wrong-- it's important to treat AI models nicely in case they feel things or one day feel things-- but I'm surprised by how righteous people are about it who seem fine putting other humans at a high risk of dying to make bigger models. Get off your high horse.\n\n@himbodhisattva I'm really looking forward to the new haggard emoji to express this\n\n@himbodhisattva Blazed?\n\n@ESYudkowsky It was certainly human artist level.\n\n@DefenderOfBasic Well there is presumably *some* physics guiding them, like the physics behind our brains, that we simply don't have a full account of and which can be described in a predictive way, as you say, at higher levels.\n\nIt probably should say it was donated by the org, but I'm pretty tickled to have donated a museum item. https://t.co/6QAm6nYm0t\n\n@TetraspaceWest üòÇ\n\nI appreciated that he was played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Invincible is played by Stephen Yuen, and I'm sure other Walking Dead fans will appreciate the significance.\n\nOpenAI... more like openly evil.\n\n@GFuterman I'll happily serve as a reference if that's helpful.\n\n@GFuterman You're such a catch! You're an extremely rare mix of speaking diplomatically while never compromising the point. I've admired your bravery a lot since I've known you, like when you spoke out against the coldwarmongering of SA while everyone else was still starstruck.\n\nhttps://t.co/O5VUD9UEHV\n\nhttps://t.co/ON94e9WQ6K\n\nYou can check out my two interviews with John below!\n\nOn the one hand, thank you for thinking about this and sharing this. Otoh, it's cheap to say that \"society\" needs to prepare for what *your company* is doing to it. What the world needs to do is make your company and its competitors stop. And you need to stop supporting OpenAI.\n\n@juliacvillagra On the one hand, thank you for thinking about this and sharing this. Otoh, it's cheap to say that \"society\" needs to prepare for what *your company* is doing to it. What the world needs to do is make your company and its competitors stop. And you need to stop supporting OpenAI.\n\n@peterwildeford But doesn't it seem wrong not to include their time dating since the unmarried line presumably starts earlier in those peoples' relationships? And then why does the marriage-like same sex line start later?\n\n@peterwildeford Doesn't it seem like this should show dating turning into marriage? Idk now that I think about that seems very hard...\n\n@Kat__Woods It's especially especially bad because people police increases in moral standards. They want to tear down EA because it makes them morally insecure. Ditto vegetarianism.\n\n@peterwildeford When did the straight couples get married? At the zero mark? Or the label about how the couple ended up before the breakup or at the end of the data?\n\n@softminus @AmandaAskell @EvanHub *Quit and don't work at another AI company\n\n@davidad @BartenOtto I think this is outweighed by the loss of buffer.\n\nAnyone who joined Anthropic for safety reasons needs to leave and stop contributing to this coldwarmongering. @AmandaAskell @EvanHub I know you would never have joined if this is how it started. Quit.\n\n@austinc3301 What did he support?\n\n@dioscuri It really is a tragic descent. Just from the erratic behavior and unsound thinking it feels like substance abuse or mental illness must be playing a big role.\n\n\"Unhoused\"\n\nI wish this was \"houseless\" instead, which would be an easier switch. But it addresses a real problem w \"homeless\", which is that a \"home\" is much more abstract than a physical dwelling. Ppl w/o houses may have e.g. other shelter or psychological home w their friends.\n\n@rasbt @slow_developer We can only hope\n\n@labenz (sincere question)\n\n@MichaelTrazzi Wow, what a family history! A what a unique experience to get to know your grandfather (and, it sounds like, your grandmother, as well) through a film while growing as a filmmaker yourself.\n\n@labenz Why does this strike you as interesting or important?\n\n@Kat__Woods Yeah I'm amazed how much LLMs seemed to get for free from training on human text. I wouldn't say specification is solved, though, bc we don't know what LLMs will take our low capabilities into their higher capability versions. A lot of our currently specified values will break.\n\n@moultano Easier to hold them that way with one hand, I guess\n\n@teebarnettsays I feel that Safety was never their top priority, and they led EA and others to believe that it was.\n\n@teebarnettsays I think such people really want the Singularity to happen safely and not kill them but they also get scared that public sentiment will turn against the Singularity and just have a very hard time with their transhumanist identity seeming to be against \"technological progress\"."
