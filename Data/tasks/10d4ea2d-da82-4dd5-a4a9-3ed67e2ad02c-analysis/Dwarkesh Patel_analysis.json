Enjoy!\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00:00 - Humans didn‚Äôt succeed because of raw IQ\n0:10:13 - How cultural evolution works\n0:21:34 - Why is brain size declining?\n0:32:46 - Will AGI have superhuman cultural learning?\n0:43:20 - Why the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe\n0:56:16 - Why China, Rome, India got left behind\n1:21:55 - Loss of cultural variance in modern world\n1:32:06 - Is individual genius real?\n01:44:35 - IQ and collective brains\n\nThis was really good. \n\nAs you listen to these interesting nerd snipey arguments, it‚Äôs worth emphasizing that Will is describing something that is quite plausible in the next decade or two. \n\nThey‚Äôre talking about our timeline folks!\n\nLet @ashleevance know!\n\nAnd subscribe to Core Memory!\n\n@DanielleFong üòÇ\n\nThe most interesting part of the @JoHenrich interview was when he explained how the Catholic Church unintentionally caused the Industrial Revolution!\n\nThe Church wanted to acquire land and wealth that would otherwise remain within extended kinship networks. \n\nSo they systematically dismantled these competing kin system of Early Medieval Europe. \n\n\"By the high Middle Ages, you get the rise of guilds, which are voluntary groups of craftsmen and self-help societies, because people don't have their families to rely on.\n\nPeople begin moving around, there's occupational sorting into different occupations, urbanization is rising, charter towns are on the rise, universities pop up, new kinds of monasteries pop up.\"\n\nFull episode out tomorrow!\n\n@willmacaskill @robertwiblin The faster the intelligence explosion, the longer the podcast!\n\nYou'll get to work with a hilarious, brilliant, intense gentleman scientist who has decoded ancient scrolls, plotted out a terraform of Mars, and is currently making cheap synthetic fuel from sunlight and air.\n\nWhy haven't you applied?\n\n@adamvsteele To be clear, at no point do I think Mao was actually a great leader. The Communists winning the civil war was a tragedy. But it's a good quote!\n\n‚ÄúHad Mao died in 1956, his achievements would have been immortal. Had he died in 1966, he would still have been a great man but flawed. But he died in 1976. Alas, what can one say?‚Äù\n\n- Chen Yun, a leading Chinese Communist Party official under Mao and Deng Xiaoping\n\n@amytcun oh no ... wasn't me this time right üëÄ\n\n@sgrove I'm in! DMing\n\n@s8mb Same thing with ordering. It doesn‚Äôt take 15 minutes to read a menu, but that‚Äôs how much most waiters will give you. \n\nMy solution is to declare that I‚Äôm ready to order as we‚Äôre sitting down, even if I haven‚Äôt seen the menu."

  "summary": "The main topics discussed by @Dwarkesh Patel in the past week include physics concepts such as vacuum decay, cultural evolution, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), human success attributed to cultural evolution rather than raw intelligence, the Industrial Revolution, and the impact of the Catholic Church on history. The tweets also mention interviews with physicist Adam Brown and discussions on brain size decline, collective brains, and the potential of AGI hive minds. Overall, the sentiment seems to be intellectually curious and engaging with complex concepts.",
