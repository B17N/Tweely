Exit window or death!\n\n@mteamisloading They seriously need to add a liveness condition to let others step in if the centralized co-signer dies.\n\n@evan_van_ness This chart is going to look so nice when Lido dual governance releases and the prospective LDO attack has an exit window applied to it.\n\n@RandomCTGuy Yes. I don't know. I don't care.\n\n@alice_und_bob @Gasp_xyz This is what I meant with the trustless bridges from the respective L1s. The crux of my argument is the single \"proof of execution correctness\" L1. This construct is a rollup of exclusively that L1 with potentially other trustless bridges.\n\n@RandomCTGuy Granted. Centralized mechanisms are unethical to launch and stage two is simply a decent metric by which to gauge a rollup's effort towards eliminating centralized mechanisms.\n\n@ethereumintern_ I did not do enough due diligence to confirm how this worked beyond finding the smoking liveness failure gun of this required sequencer co-signing.\n\n@erayajk @hievalir &gt;the smart contract should be unable to steal all of my money\n\nsorry for expecting this\n\n@hievalir Your system is very good. It is very novel.\n\nWhy don't you put a liveness check on the centralized co-signer? If they don't show up for 12 hours anyone is allowed to sign.\n\n@hievalir Calling trustlessness a frill is a despicable symptom of the ideological rot that has settled in during this last cycle of pure degeneracy; @l2beat does the work of angels by pushing definitions for honesty and highlighting the issues with Ethereum L2s and I simply do that here.\n\nI appreciate all novel L2 work. Simple and pragmatic is good. But trustlessness is not a frill. If this rollup launches without an exit window then it is unethical. End of story. We just need an exit window.\n\nIt is equally as unethical as any lesser alt-L1 willingly sacrificing user security with weak tradeoffs. It is as unethical as any other rollup launching a mainnet without being stage two. Mechanisms whereby a centralized party can intervene to cause state to be lost or to prevent a user from reclaiming funds is not what we need to be building. This is another failure to deliver a solution to users that actually inherits Ethereum security properly.\n\nI hope talented teams reconsider taking shortcuts and building centralized mechanisms like this. We can do better, and users deserve better, and it's time to stop permitting a degree of centralized control in L2s that would be appalling in DeFi or worse than what OpenSea had five years ago.\n\nI've been thinking about this more and you are obviously correct, this is how an exit window would work for either of the L1s. In that case my only contention would be that social consensus is not obvious and e.g. users who only want to be secured by Ethereum need to inquire of every project ahead of time to confirm that they intend to use Ethereum for the escape destination.\n\nWhat I am talking about and confused by is whether this is somehow a limitation imposed by Starknet in their current centralized state; there was some mention in their space today about \"dual finality\" which explicitly waits for both Ethereum and Bitcoin. They mentioned docs about this are forthcoming and I hope to read them to understand more.\n\nThe issue is the escape hatch for the L2 on multiple L1s requires finality on all of the L1s to change state not part of the trustless bridges, i.e. the native state is subject to liveness of the weakest of the multiple L1s instead of inheriting only the security of the strongest.\n\nRollups offer the ability to do arbitrary mesasge-passing so any application can perform any migration that it needs. This can be relevant for applications and usecases that are non-financial and don't deal with assets at all; imagine exporting game data or social graph data like EFP, for instance. These are examples of state that would need to be generated directly on an L2 but which may have sufficient value to merit escaping to L1.\n\n@semenov_roman_ I argue that if L2s are to scale Ethereum, we should have guarantees for state that is natively created on those L2s. Rollups do offer this.\n\n@tgwxyz @jillrgunter @divine_economy @pdes_igns @Tyr_Capital Distributed in-person at the Denver Soiree; scanned and uploaded here. https://t.co/qC2qwfnA3c\n\n@dimahledba I would gladly take you up on that. Here is my primary literature for the economic security argument, which is perhaps the most contestable point of mine. https://t.co/11j21eK3W0\n\nIf the resources are separate, then fair enough. At least from your marketing and leadership, Bitcoin seems like a huge focus. As an Ethereum user, who has chosen Ethereum for a reason, who has historically been interested in what I believed would be an Ethereum L2, this is entirely uninteresting.\n\nBitcoin has no client diversity. It has lower total cost of attack than Ethereum. It lacks the geographic validator distribution of Ethereum. It lacks the decentralization inherent to systems free of huge operating expense. It suffers from an existential security budget issue. And all of that without even being fully programmable.\n\nI genuinely do not care at all whether or not Starknet ever has a trustless Bitcoin bridge. I care quite a lot about when Starknet becomes a viable option for actually scaling Ethereum.\n\n@dimahledba Good luck. You guys do good work, just please focus on your exit window instead of playing in Bitcoin land.\n\n@joakimhi Correct, but \"this is a Bitcoin rollup or an Ethereum rollup depending on the application designer's choices\" is definitely messier than an L2 with a single clear destination for native state evacuation, and it's something that people do not talk about enough.\n\nIn response to this. https://t.co/R5dDdLol4H\n\nHow does an L2 settle to multiple L1s? This cannot be: either social consensus for all natively-issued state is required, or one assumes the security of the weaker L1.\n\nLet's be charitable and ignore the marketing. Let's assume the platonic ideal future with real exit windows on both Ethereum and Bitcoin. Starknet is not here yet; its bridges are centralized. BitVM is not trustless the way OP_CAT would enable real Bitcoin L2s. But in this ideal future, Ether bridged via Ethereum is safe. Bitcoin bridged via Bitcoin is safe.\n\nHowever, a trustless bridge alone does not make something an L2. A trustless bridge allows any chain to operate with the same assumptions as a proper L2, but only for assets that have been deposited into that bridge. There are no assurances for state generated natively on the L2.\n\nAn example: suppose Gnosis Chain had an L2-style trustless Ether bridge. Even though Gnosis is an alt-L1, I could use this bridge to move my Ether onto Gnosis and use it safely on Gnosis. However, if I created my own token on Gnosis, there is no trustless mechanism to bring that token home to Ethereum if Gnosis disappeared. Using an L2 such as Optimism, an Ethereum transaction can be trustlessly force-included (even if Optimism disappeared) that manipulated L2 state such that the L2-issued token is burnt an an equivalent token is minted on Ethereum.\n\nThe trustless evacuation of state from L2 to L1, with no reliance on social consensus, is a defining feature of what it means to be an L2. If I issue the same token natively on Starknet, and then Starknet disappears:\n\n1) Do I force-include my escape transaction on either L1 and choose to bring my token to Ethereum or to Bitcoin? Would there end up a worthless copy of my token on the L1 I did not choose? Now my users need to be aware of my real intent ahead of time: social consensus is required.\n\nor 2) Do I need to force-include the transaction in both places? If so, the L2 is weakened to be reliant upon the less secure of the two L1s. Starknet would not be an \"Ethereum and Bitcoin rollup\" and would be a \"Bitcoin rollup with a trustless Ethereum bridge\".\n\n@llamaonthebrink Congratulations!\n\n@GwartyGwart None of this is bullish for worthless governance coins but all of that tokenization activity is quite bullish for Ether.\n\n@LouisThibault87 @kennyistyping Don't worry about it. Here's a roadmap for you. https://t.co/Bpm2qTDMvQ\n\n@kennyistyping This is simply Ethereum presenting the honest truth. You can make any ten year plan fractally complex if you break it out into items like this. The entire roadmap could just say \"make Ethereum faster with no trade-offs\". Also, contributors are paid."
