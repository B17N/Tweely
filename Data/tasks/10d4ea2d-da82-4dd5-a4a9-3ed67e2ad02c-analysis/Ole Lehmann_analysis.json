lol\n\n@512Montana @ManusAI_HQ got one now but no spare unfortunately\n\n@Domi_Hess much harder though\n\n@NorthstarBrain @ARCDigiFuture it looks okay, but not well designed\n\n@cj_zZZz there are probably people who enjoy doing calculus manually\n\nim not sure you understood my statement here\n\nWant to turn these AI trends into profit?\n\nI break down exactly how I'm using the latest AI breakthroughs to grow my internet income beyond 7-figures.\n\n45,000+ entrepreneurs already get these insights weekly.\n\nJoin them: https://t.co/e7zPiMwSCG\n\nBtw, if you wanna try out some video ads yourself, here's the link to the platform: https://t.co/zlFCU4kS1V\n\n• UGC-style content without the massive pain of hunting down creators\n\nThis feels like being early to social media ads or email marketing.\n\nThe brands that move first here are going to have a massive arbitrage opportunity. https://t.co/vWivuzGKJD\n\nIts already happening.\n\nMajor brands like Coca-Cola, Nike &amp; Heinz have all began using AI in their campaigns.\n\nThe most practical uses right now?\n\n• Scroll-stopping hooks that would take days to shoot\n• Product demos with different messaging for different audiences\n\nI predict by 2026-27, brands NOT using AI video ad-gen will be at a massive disadvantage.\n\nThe gap will widen fast:\n\n• 30-50% better ROI compared to traditional production\n• Personalization that's impossible to do manually at scale\n• Production costs cut by 90%\n\n• Scripts that convert better than anything I've written myself\n• 1-click A/B testing that would take days manually\n\nThis isn't just about saving time &amp; money anymore (though it does that too).\n\nWith this level of AI quality in 2025, it's now *finally* about better results.\n\nThese AI-generated video ads are actually *outperforming* traditional UGC conversion rates.\n\nNot just matching - BEATING it.\n\nHere's why (and what you can do with Icon):\n\n• AI-generated avatars that hold and interact with your ACTUAL products https://t.co/cjhwQET4QV\n\nI just found this video maker called Icon and I'm honestly shocked at what it can do.\n\nTLDR: AI-generated videos have finally crossed the threshold from utter garbage to actually better than 90%+ of real human creators.\n\nThe data I'm seeing from early adopters is wild: https://t.co/8Fw01z8Xpn\n\nThis is the ChatGPT moment for video marketing.\n\nRemember that first time using ChatGPT? The realization that writing had forever changed?\n\nThis one tool just gave me the exact same feeling with AI video creation.\n\nHere's why AI video has finally crossed the Rubicon 🧵: https://t.co/PJziJTyvXS\n\n@bio_vidigal that means you might need to discover what you are here for on earth\n\n@LouisCooper_ cope imo\n\nyou seem capable, there a million way to make more money than in crypto\n\n@NorthstarBrain im sorry alex, but this doesnt look like a 5k design lol\n\n@duncanbudd quilt codebase\n\nif you want to automate most of your job, you chose the wrong one\n\n@taherdhanera ?\n\n@longevitymaxi + creatine\n\n@longevitymaxi - blueprint essentials\n- fish oil (heavy metal tested)\n- NAC\n- magnesium complex\n\n@petheth soon youll buy software at the local farmers market\n\n@petheth yeah\n\nI'm wondering if we'll see a revival of \"manual coding\" the way people meet to do manual calligraphy/analog photography etc as a hobby\n\nwhere you do it manually because you love it\n\n@alxcollignon lol\n\n@ell_i_s you starting to turn hostile here is just confirming the vibe I got from you\n\nI have an open conversations with loads of people every day\n\nand no, I cant remember everyone commenting on my stuff I get 100s of replies each day\n\nI dont care about being popular mate\n\n@petheth yeah, i should stop wasting my time even writing this post haha\n\n@cryptogr8times hahahahah\n\n@balanceforge yes whats odd about that\n\nif your daily mood is affected by crypto prices you fucked your life up mate\n\ntime for a change\n\n@cryptogr8times great pivot as well\n\n@skyblixt its a joke^^\n\n@FPCHD also okay\n\nI'm f*cking steamrolling my vision for longevity maxi into existence\n\nyou'll see in 6-12 months\n\nI'm a bulldozer GET OUT MY WAY\n\n@ell_i_s @richardrx @ManusAI_HQ https://t.co/UCOs0lGPfC\n\nsomeone on here called me fake or \"capping\" because I tell people to reach out and then don't answer\n\nlet's look at the reality:\n\nIf you send a message like this:\n\n- no context\n- no idea who you are / what you want\n- can't get an idea about you from looking at your profile\n\nwhat does this tell me?\n\nyou don't even spend 2 minutes on crafting a message and expect me to spend time answering?\n\nI get a shitload of inbound each day and it take a lot of time to answer everyone.\n\nif you don't pass this simple filter, it's on you\n\nskill issue\n\n@ell_i_s @ManusAI_HQ https://t.co/4kfO8WfBKK\n\nyou send me this message, zero context, anything and you want me to reply?\n\nI get a fuckload of messages each day and if someone doesnt even spend 2 minutes on explaining what they do and want, I dont anwer\n\ninstead of talking to me in that pissed tone, look at your comms instead\n\nskill issue\n\n@ell_i_s @richardrx @ManusAI_HQ i dont like the way you speak mate, I owe you nothing and I dont like your vibe thats why\n\nhave a nice day\n\nif you're in crypto pivot to welding\n\n@bricf13 i never understood this mindset\n\ni can so much joy from trying things and building\n\n@ManusAI_HQ @NorthstarBrain help sir\n\n@NorthstarBrain how can I get manus access"
