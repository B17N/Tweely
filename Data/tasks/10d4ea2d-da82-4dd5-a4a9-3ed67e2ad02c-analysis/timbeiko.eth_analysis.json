The first one will focus on the intersection of distributed AI and blockchains ü§ñ https://t.co/g4u6VnQ5hl\n\nAt a smaller scale, we also have several paid writing opportunities for contributions to Protocolized ‚úçÔ∏è https://t.co/Y8K5dyibfz\n\nOur Curriculum Development Track has 500K$ in grants available to fund college-level courses around protocols, with GCC sponsoring a Chinese language track. \n\nWe‚Äôll kick the summer off with a Curriculum Development workshop at @JoinEdgeCity üìö https://t.co/1Sfv6h8AvA\n\nSummer of Protocols is back for 2025 ‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nIn 2023, our guiding question was whether ‚Äúprotocols‚Äù should be studied as a first class topic. After validating that, 2024 focused on applied research, in fields ranging from cryptography to wildfire prevention. \n\nIn 2025, our focus is education both via our Curriculum Development Program, and revamped Protocolized publication! \n\nMore info on all of this below üëá\n\n@christine_dkim @LidoFinance Just to clarify: this will delay Pectra relative to the hacky Holesky fixes working without issues (not a given!), but the \"delay\" comes from infra teams testing. Client teams can (rest and then) start working on the next thing! \n\nOverall, this is the quickest path to Fusak üòÑ\n\nYou can just do things ü´°\n\n@notnotstorm We discussed this on ACD today!  \n\nWe're a bit busy right now trying to save Holesky and getting Hoodi up, but there was some support for a testnet that would serve this purpose. \n\nSomething like: \n- Sepolia ‚Üí Dev Testnet \n- Hoodi ‚Üí Infra Testnet \n- TBD ‚Üí ACD Perf Testnet\n\nhttps://t.co/oZNKHnX6a3\n\nACDE Recap\n\nA new testnet, Hoodi, is going live Monday to wrap up Pectra testing, if you need to test validator exits, be on the lookout for it! Everything else can be tested on Sepolia & Holesky. \n\nPectra will be scheduled 30+ days after Hoodi forks successfully,  pending infra and client testing. \n\nFusaka planning will run in parallel, with a deadline of March 24 to propose EIPs, and a tentative date of April 10 for a scope freeze ü´°\n\nFull recap on @EthMagicians, link below üëá\n\n@hasufl the most annoying thing for my taxes this year üòÖ"
