I had to contact their support to get it back up.\n\nThen it happened again. And again.\n\nThe fragility of web2 services can't be overstated tbh.\n\n@shazow Just another pivot like when MEV didn‚Äôt exist on solony and now it‚Äôs the primary value prop of the chain..\n\n@ethcoredevs_ ü´∂\n\n@YourKaiCrypto @0xMert_ be the liquidity you wish to see in the world\n\n@0xMert_ https://t.co/cOx0DCq6mH\n\n@0xMert_ ayo?\n\nhttps://t.co/tsARWncFMv https://t.co/foALJdDWqU\n\nhttps://t.co/IG23KNsSxb\n\nNew Market Alert!\n\nWill Russia agree to a ceasefire before Easter?\n\nLink to market in the replies üëá\n\n@arixoneth yeah their only options would be to extract more or exit\n\nalso bandwidth costs have to be pretty non-trivial even if they are using data centres for cheap hardware\n\nSeeing a lot of misunderstandings about this SIMD.\n\nThe reason it was rejected was because validators made the right economic choice.\n\nAbsent SOL emissions, these validators would need to begin extracting a lot more  in order to be profitable, or simply operate at a loss.\n\nWhat we saw as a result of SIMD is that no matter how much IBRL is spammed on the timeline, the economics of running a validator can‚Äôt be ignored.\n\nThe cost to validate on sol is very very high. The cost to even run a full node is very very high.\n\nThat means you can‚Äôt just do minimal viable issuance like ethereum wants to, because on eth, validators have very modest hardware and bandwidth requirements, they do not operate at a loss the same way other chains do.\n\nEthereum also doesn‚Äôt have massive foundation based subsidies for validators either, these validators validate because it is profitable to do so!\n\nPpl often forget how mature and sound Ethereum‚Äôs are economics are, but you can be quickly reminded by just looking under the hood of other chains.\n\n>‚Äúbut to do this we just need to extract less from the actual users/retail of the chain -- let's do what is best and grow the pie together, yay or nay?‚Äù\n\nYou read this wrong, it‚Äôs literally the opposite.\n\nThis SIMD would mean that the only way validators could sustain is by extracting MEV. They would literally need to extract more to make up for it.\n\n@_MouseDev @networkspirits &lt;3\n\nThis may not seem like much, but it means a lot to our team.\n\nTo the first of many thousands more to come ü´°\n\nFor real though all L1 designs eventually converge on the rollup-centric roadmap, just in different form factors.\n\nThrough that lens it's almost intuitive that the chain which acknowledges and build towards that reality is the one that's best positioned long term.\n\nRollups with small quorum or single sequencer designs were right. \n\nIykyk.\n\n@virotechnics is this real lol\n\n@Kira_sama @JasonYanowitz nah\n\nGuy(s) who's entire persona and success comes from easy access to seed round deals has an opinion about ETH sentiment. \n\n(Many such cases on the timeline rn)\n\n@litocoen @mteamisloading chads, the both of you. https://t.co/lPR10KDME4\n\n@AustinAdams10 @Truemarketsorg TRUE mentioned!! https://t.co/BuBXjNbPtu\n\n@Athio92 @JasonYanowitz those are rollups, go look at defi protocols, many of which have more TVL than rollups\n\nThis comes with the territory of \"passive LPing.\" \n\nTrying to create passive counterparty strategies to highly active liquidity venues will always lead to these sort of events.\n\nPpl like that Hyperliquid was always *liquid* even on longtail pairs, but it's a double edged sword.\n\nBtw @Truemarketsorg prediction market on HLP incoooming üòÅ\n\n@JasonYanowitz but state street and JPM can't magically get hacked for their AUM\n\nTVL is an important security-lindy metric, all of the highest TVL projects are also the most secure\n\nunless you think that transaction reversible custody is preferable\n\nPeak F*cking Performance.\n\n@smyyguy https://t.co/8UT4YdlbHc\n\n@GwartyGwart the ironic thing is that this is actually a *level up* from what the code is being primarily used for on solano right now lol  \n\nthey literally took all the opensource eth code, fitted it for the SVM, and built a memecoin landfill on top of lol\n\nHonestly this is such a useful feature for sorting the markets and categories you want to follow.\n\nSurprised Polymarket doesn't have something like it..\n\n@ABitWhaleish @AnteFinance https://t.co/6RknPGruP7\n\n@fabdarice ü´∂\n\nIdc what anyone says, the pressure that crypto projects are under while deploying code to production is unlike anything else. I'm reminded of this every time I see it happen.\n\nTruemarekts is finally live, it took a bit longer than expected but hopefully the community will feel like it's worth it!\n\nWell I guess I don't need to tease yall any longer do I? Check it out for yourselves!!!\n\n(and if you don't, I will shill it to you everyday until you do üòÅ)\n\n@TruebieMarkets @GwartyGwart @Truemarketsorg gwart pod gud\n\n@TruebieMarkets @GwartyGwart @Truemarketsorg lol\n\n@smyyguy @Truemarketsorg any particularly recommended sources? (without shilling me a blockworks sub haha)\n\n@Impose_eth @Truemarketsorg ü´†\n\nDon't worry you'll be able to bet on Pumpfun revenue on @Truemarketsorg in a matter of hours\n\nNow that the final $TRUE snapshot has been taken, I just wanted to take a moment to thank all of our amazing Patrons, the earliest supporters of the project and the heart of our community üíôü´∂üíôü´∂üíô\n\nAfter months of secondary activity since the original mint, the Patron holder distribution became (impressively) decentralized imo.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Patrons represent close to the entire TRUE float at launch, and that \"Other Accounts\" portion in the chart below (>1/3rd of the pie), is made up over a thousand wallets!\n\nWe're grateful to have such an awesome community!\n\nLong Live @Truemarketsorg!! ‚úåÔ∏è\n\n@zedweb3 honestly it's probably kraken wallet migration\n\n@coinmamba @kyledoops what makes you say that\n\nAnyone confirm this? Big if true.\n\nJust under 3 hours to go! \n\nsmol reminder to be mindful of this timestamp if you have open bids on the collection üôè\n\n@networkspirits @Truemarketsorg hi\n\nSame vibes https://t.co/9TMu7lSfkd\n\nThe reason ppl have this extractive view of the chain is because the ecosystem has hardly produced anything new, has created little open source value, and has played deceptive narrative games for years.\n\nThe fact that ‚ÄúMEV‚Äù infra is the most funded thing on that chain right now is literal evidence of that.\n\nIn 2023, Ethereum was criticized by podcasters because there was too much focus on MEV and scaling infra by VCs.\n\nIn 2021, the solana narrative was that It didn‚Äôt have evil extractive MEV like ethereum does, that blocks were produced so fast that the demand for ordering preference just magically evaporates. \n\nThis was literally touted by sol leadership and others in crypto media.\n\nToday, the entire value prop and narrative for solana is that you stake SOL to earn MEV. \n\nThey went from saying MEV is evil and doesn‚Äôt exist on solana to building the entire ecosystem on top of it. They even try to rally behind a new (rather unoriginal) name for MEV as if it erases this history.\n\nIn 2020 Ethereum created a ton of net new use cases and open source protocols that are the basis and foundation of all onchain applications that exist today, on all chains, regardless of the VM being used.\n\nThere was a wealth effect that had legitimacy to it. Something legitimately new was being experimented with in real time.\n\nBut for the past year, nearly all the activity on Solana has been purely extractive, with little produced value for the industry. \n\nFor those who don‚Äôt know, MEV literally stands for Maximal Extractable Value. And this is now the basis of the sol ecosystem. Something which wasn‚Äôt supposed to exist.\n\nMEV.  It‚Äôs literally in the name.\n\n@fozzydiablo https://t.co/BdHFdHTTn9\n\n@0xdoug That‚Äôs basically what Arbitrum does right?\n\n@_ryanrconnor God you lose more credibility by the day"
