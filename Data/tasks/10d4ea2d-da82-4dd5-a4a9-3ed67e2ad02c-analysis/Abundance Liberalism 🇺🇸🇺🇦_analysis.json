I don't even blame the men. You gotta do what you gotta do to survive. \n\nhttps://t.co/o1Czy1bdSw\n\n@AlyssaLogic @mattyglesias FIRE is the only consistent defendor of free speech out there\n\n@PhilMitchell83 It was physical strength advantage of men. Women and children would often be physically thrown out life boats by male crew members. The intention wasn't gender discrimination, the ancient law of a sinking ship was \"Every man for himself\". But it result in massive deaths of women\n\n@goldnecklace2 @jwilcox79 I help my bestfriend in homeschooling her daughter and literally the first rule is no phones. It corrupts the mind.\n\nThe Titanic was a horrible atrocity against men. But we should remember that historically women didn't survive shipwrecks. Survival in shipwrecks would have the reverse ratio of the Titanic. 80-20 men. The Titanic flipped the gender discrimination around.\n\n@SarkerNotParker @ArmandDoma Holy fuck, that statement is incredible\n\n@goldnecklace2 @neontaster A successful marriage requires you to be best friends as well. You have to be able to tolerate the other at their worst. And you need something to talk about for 60-70 years. Need to share common interests for that.\n\n@SarkerNotParker @maxdubler The seizures are the result of black nationalism. A lot of South African politicians want to do Rhodesia but in reverse.\n\n@SarkerNotParker @maxdubler South Africa gave me Elon Musk. Between replying to your tweet, I saw another Elon Musk tweet and was reminded how an illegal alien is ruining my country. \n\nSouth Africa's entire problem seems to be sky high levels of crime and incredible lack of state capacity and corruption.\n\n@SarkerNotParker @mattyglesias @sunraysunray But ideological realignment is also happening in Canada\n\n@SarkerNotParker @maxdubler It couldn't fix South Africa. Never met a nice South African. Nothing can fix that place.\n\n@SarkerNotParker @maxdubler Is there anything a land value tax can't fix?\n\n@literally_chad @StatisticUrban Utica was close to falling at the time. A siege of Carthage would have suddenly been much more possible with a city as large as Utica to use as a base.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @neontaster Explaining physics concepts would be annoying to most people but my wife loves it. I get laid after I nerd out and give her a physics lecture.\n\n@literally_chad @StatisticUrban One of the most alt history scenarios is, what if Hannibal wins the Battle of Zama and Scipio is killed in battle?\n\n@literally_chad @StatisticUrban The obvious blunder was allowing Africanus to take Carthago Nova. And Hannibal should have used the elephants as anti cavalry at Zama.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @SCDC87 @CartoonsHateHer My last foreign trip was in 2023 was to visit my grandfather in England. Have done zero travelling since then. I got married in the lawn of my in laws. But I am gonna go to Japan for honeymoon.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @SCDC87 @CartoonsHateHer Not just flying, any travelling. I don't even do drives or weekend trips. I only do staycations, not vacations. Only travelling I have done is to visit family.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @SCDC87 @CartoonsHateHer Yeah, I am not a fan of self diagnosis, if you think you are autistic or ADHD, go to a psychiatrist. Don't post on Twitter.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @SCDC87 @CartoonsHateHer &gt;Idk traveling gives me anxiety\n\nYou too? After my wife, you are the only person I know who has this\n\n@goldnecklace2 @SCDC87 @CartoonsHateHer Fair enough, it's more of a spectrum. My classical signs of autism are a very strong stim and I was late in talking.\n\n@StatisticUrban And in 217BC, Hannibal was in Italy\n\n@StatisticUrban You are gonna fail because without stable supply lines you cannot beseige Rome\n\n@NickyFrank30 I think we should force Republicans to abolish the filibuster\n\n@goldnecklace2 @SCDC87 @CartoonsHateHer But it's not normal to only but clothes from one brand because everything else itches. Or have the concept of travelling trigger anxiety.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @catherineroyuk And you don't even need to give opioids. A nerve blocker can also easily do the job.\n\n@reesetheone1 The implicit statement here is that increased white support is worth losing black or Latino votes. As an electoral strategy, this isn't a bad gamble. White people are still 2/3rds of the country and they are more likely to show up for the midterms.\n\nYou have clearly never suffered from university DEI.\n\nIn September, Republicans attach a national ban on abortion to a CR. Should Dems vote for it?\n\n@chuckborris1331 @Det_Yoda @MaxNordau @DrewPavlou The Nazis bombed Warsaw\n\n@Azhtr0 @Det_Yoda @MaxNordau @DrewPavlou Sometimes, history is that simple\n\n@AlyssaLogic @mattyglesias But they do vote against higher energy bills\n\nMan, this is so evil\n\nFuck off\n\n@RealJoyJackson @admcrlsn Just look at the massive swing to the right in New York. It was all immigration.\n\n@SpecialPuppy1 Because Sinema was obstructing Biden\n\nEvery single day\n\n@AlexxFromATX We should get rid of the cultural convention that boys can't wear girl's clothes. I have worn them as a dare and I will attest that they are very comfortable, especially if you have a high metabolism. Allows for good heat flow.\n\n@AlexxFromATX Yeah, I am deeply sceptical of minors transitioning. I think it's very possible for a boy to be a boy and not be into boyish things.\n\n@constans @InlandCaGuy You are gonna have to reform entitlements, at some point, though.\n\n@InlandCaGuy Democrats need to broadly speaking, be left wing on economics and be very right wing on illegal migration and crime, and normal right wing on DEI and trans issues.\n\n@watidoink @Guardian_Vyala They need to learn to kiss. What the fuck is this?\n\n@KarolusWangus Poorly part timers should not be doing that, then\n\n@KarolusWangus It's the job of the military to not kill innocent people. We respect them because we hold them to higher standards.\n\n@Jay_McGill94 @VeeCeeMurphy76 DEI is dead. It's association with HR killed it\n\n@KarolusWangus One guy killed was a bystander\n\n@admcrlsn Her past statements on ICE and immigration are going to make it very hard for her to win a base that has turned against immigration.\n\nWhy not?\n\n@goldnecklace2 @ReubenR80027912 Musk is already purging everything. This is why a lot of Dems are comfortable. Musk is already doing it\n\n@progressbuckeye And how do we know Musk is not gonna DOGE everything?\n\n@CriticalDragon1 If you have gone through male puberty, you have advantages in muscles and lung and heart capacity.\n\n@progressbuckeye Democrats are gonna shut down the government because the base is demanding all out resistance and is white hot with rage at Schumer. Jeffries is throwing Schumer under the bus here.\n\nI am seeing white hot rage at Schumer\n\n@BigD_Democrat Fair enough, my bad\n\n@BigD_Democrat I also laugh at it but this attack line really resonates with people for some reason. We should have some counter against it.\n\n@BigD_Democrat A lot of people to consider trans rights to be communism. I have had at least 5 people, tell me that they are going to vote for Trump because Democrat's communist trans policies.\n\n@churroallie This is going to go away the moment the left touches cultural issues\n\n@CriticalDragon1 Not biologically, they are not. There should be two sports categories, women and general. Cis women in the women's category and anyone can compete in the general category.\n\n@Jeffdc5 Every single faction of the Democratic party is livid at Schumer for this\n\n@BigD_Democrat Trans is not popular, right now\n\n@AlexxFromATX But mostly methane\n\nHe walked right into that one. No one told him to capitulate\n\n@kwakara91 And thus, was born quantum mechanics. Out of a mathematical trick, an act of desperation to explain why objects glowed the way they do.\n\n@kwakara91 But whatever, as far as he was concerned, it worked. Einstein used to explain quantization to explain the photoelectric effect. Neils Bohr, for no real reason, decided to quantise the angular momentum of electrons. He had no reason but that explained the hydrogen spectrum.\n\n@kwakara91 But it worked. E=hf, and he was correctly able to get the experimental data from his model. After weeks of thinking, he found an explanation, action. Action was something proposed by some French mathematician and here it was showing up at the heart of the universe.\n\n@kwakara91 Enter Max Planck. He worked on this problem for years with absolutely no success. Until he did something, no one had thought of, quantising energy. It was an act of desperation, just a mathematical trick. He had no theoretical explanation for this.\n\n@kwakara91 This problem persisted. No matter what tweaks or changes we made, classical physics said that objects should be emitting absurd amounts of UV and X-rays. Physics was essentially deemed over, but this one problem just couldn't be solved.\n\n@kwakara91 So basically everything with a temperature emits radiation and at around 800K, visible light. Pure classical physics gave us the Rayleigh - Jeans model which was okay at low temperatures but at high temperatures went completely off the rails. It did not match experiments at all https://t.co/2ThrSnIVTE\n\n@kwakara91 Me keeping the tradition alive by knowing a lot about science and history. If anyone wants to know about the birth of quantum mechanics, I am here to explain. It's far stranger than you think. It starts with glowing objects.\n\n@kwakara91 The Intellectual Life of the British Working Class. Very good book. \n\nWe used to be far more curious about the world. I don't romanticise the past but losing that thirst for knowledge was very bad for us as a civilization.\n\nYou were in power for 14 years\n\n@Cluffalo It's called evolution\n\n@chitowngirl1982 He does speak fluent Middle Eastern, ie, authoritarian\n\nIt's the phones\n\nI love it\n\n@kwakara91 @TheSneerReview @LittleMammith This level of nonsense is certainly unheard of\n\nMy wife everyday\n\n@SarkerNotParker @clairlemon Trump won the popular vote\n\nCool, when are we overthrowing Trump?\n\n@KarolusWangus The cost of failure is death. At best, ADX Florence\n\n@darkblue714 @RBReich He is doing it already\n\n@kwakara91 @agraybee @nobodyknows2322 The only class consciousness Americans have is agreeing that there are too many immigrants and that Democrats are too woke.\n\nTHEN WHY DID YOU VOTE FOR HIM????\n\nMedicaid and social security cuts are really not popular\n\n@AlyssaLogic Hey, I have lost 30 pounds since my engagement\n\n@LittleMammith I got a smartphone at 16\n\n@jessidebergerac Okay. But you don't get to choose who to marginalise. If an opinion is held by enough people, you have to deal with it. That's democracy.\n\n@churroallie According to CBS, 65% of Democrats want all out opposition\n\n@DeuSeXDaRe I don't think Schumer is aware of how every faction in the Democratic party is livid at this blatant surrender\n\nIt's the phones\n\n@churroallie If you said stupid things in the Great Awokening, denounce it right now. So that in 2026 and 2028, you will have an actual chance.\n\n@churroallie I think her calls for abolishing ICE make it extremely difficult for her to be a national candidate. Even New York has taken a very strong anti immigrant turn.\n\n@progressbuckeye @OrganizerMemes I am glad that my senators both voted against it\n\n@progressbuckeye There are 12 Trump district Democrats who voted against the CR and Schumer is kneecapping them. If he was going to fold, which he shouldn't have, why weren't they informed earlier? Why did Schumer have them a politically dangerous move only to immediately capitulate?\n\n@AlexxFromATX Feels sad to read this after getting married\n\n@AlexxFromATX This is like me and my best friend\n\n@BigD_Democrat You are also from Arizona? I am glad my representatives and Senators voted no on the CR\n\n@Ericrse37986 @souljagoytellem No, all Senate Dems who voted for the CR\n\n@BigD_Democrat Everyone I know is livid at this cave in. A guy who was thinking about voting for Trump because of woke is also livid. Schumer is badly misreading the moment. The base is demanding all out resistance.\n\n@BigD_Democrat @Ericrse37986 Immigration, trans and crime. You have to move right on those. They are becoming an albatross around our necks.\n\n@BigD_Democrat I have never seen all the branches of the entire Democratic this united since Trump 1.0. There is a lot of disagreement over how to handle trans issues, crime, immigration but the entire party base is firmly united in opposing Trump every step of the way.\n\nSchumer is losing the neocons. It's never been more over.\n\n@KelseyTuoc Remember when some Dems said they were ready to work with DOGE? How naive we all were. I think many Senate Dems are badly misreading what the base wants. I have never seen all wings of the base this united against the CR. Even the Blue Dogs in the House are livid.\n\n@progressbuckeye I have never seen all branches of the Democratic base this united against this. Everyone is livid at Schumer for surrendering on the CR. Conservative House Dems are livid at this. They stuck out their necks and Schumer is kneecapping them.\n\n@calthrina950 After the 2024 election, Democrats felt truly defeated and centrists were ready to deal. And Trump is making all of them look like morons for thinking they could ever work with Trump, this is very likely fuelling radicalisation. They tried to reach out and were spat on.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @CartoonsHateHer Actually it's got for babies to be exposed to some bacteria and dirt. Builds up immunity and prevents auto immune disorders.\n\n@avrilbradley23 @italian_shah Downballot Dems overperform with the WWC and underperform with wealthy whites.\n\n@TheAleksee This could be event that changes things, though. Most progressive media, even those who don't attack at Dems, are livid at Schumer surrendering. Even moderate House Dems are livid.\n\n@avrilbradley23 And House Dems are livid at this. And even most moderate House Dems are furious, Democratic Tea Party might not be too far fetched. We could see an alliance between progressive and moderate Dems to oust the people they see as insufficiently anti Trump.\n\n@churroallie The issue is that while most Dems want all out resistance, they also want moderation and AOC isn't the best for that.\n\n@KelseyTuoc The big issue is that, how do Democrats know that whatever they have negotiated won't still be randomly cut by DOGE? This would have been a huge demand but I would have demanded that Elon Musk's gotta go. He has very clearly overstayed his welcome and is wrecking the government.\n\nOfficially married baby\n\n@Jay_McGill94 That's the only way a guy from California can overcome the disadvantage that comes from being from California. Harris being seen as too woke was very much influenced by her being from California.\n\n@Jay_McGill94 Is he planning on running to the right of the party in 2028?\n\n@Jeffdc5 Mississippification\n\n@kwakara91 @MattBoxer94 White men marrying Asian women is very common, though. My dad is white and my mom is Indian.\n\n@bluecolor_dem But feminists do support many of the double standards. Like affirmative action, \"Girl Power\", \"The future is female\". Young men fucking hate this stuff.\n\n@kwakara91 It is true that the Titanic and HMS Birkenhead were exceptions and that statistically, men were the most likely to survive shipwrecks as the ancient law of the sea for a sinking ship was \"Every man for himself\". Women are often physically thrown out of life boats by men.\n\n@kwakara91 My most anti free speech opinion is that we should reconsider the interpretation of the First Amendment in light of the internet and social media. I don't think humans are psychologically equipped to deal with current social media.\n\n@kwakara91 The legal equality of women and chivalry are not compatible values.\n\n@kwakara91 My fiancee (soon wife), parents and sister, and niece are the only people i would sacrifice my life for.\n\n@kwakara91 The issue is that when you defend free speech, you often have to defend the speech of a lot of extremely shitty people\n\n@kwakara91 I take that this is a jibe at Musk\n\nA lot of men feel like the way double standards are currently organised, they are the ones getting shorted and they are fucking pissed.\n\n@kwakara91 When economic issues predominated, parties could get away with being out of touch on culture. As cultural issues are becoming more and more important, parties defying the views of their constituents on culture leads to their constituents voting for illiberal parties.\n\n@kwakara91 @1_Person1_Vote Keir Starmer is PM with 34% of the vote, although the 2 party system in America means that the it will at least be over 40%.\n\n@kwakara91 Fair enough. But if you deport 25% of construction workers, that's not gonna be good for you.\n\n@1_Person1_Vote @kwakara91 Thing with parliamentary democracy is that it allows parliament to end a premiership if it's going badly. In America, we have to till January 20, 2029\n\n@kwakara91 This was bound to happen. Nationalisation of politics\n\n@kwakara91 And most construction workers are illegal aliens\n\n@TheAleksee @MitraHispana They moved 15 points right\n\nThis is how my fiancee got me\n\n@kwakara91 Oklahoma is wealthy enough that they can afford to prioritise their cultural grievances\n\n@goldnecklace2 @LittleMammith The best reason I can think of? Female version of video games\n\nShe's an US citizen\n\n@MJohnson5335 Because a lot of Americans are wealthy, 7% of the US are millionaires\n\nEspecially insane in an FPTP system\n\n@justinarchie @nobodyknows2322 Guess that was in vain\n\n@nobodyknows2322 French people rioting? Dog bites man story\n\n@Jay_McGill94 CA HSR failed because of systems put in place by Democrats\n\n@ChrissyCap42069 @Ca7Opinions @PeterMoskos Strict liability already exists in US criminal law. Felony murder doctrine.\n\n@EveKeneinan Good for God. I am still more interested in being amongst the living. And anyways, I am an atheist.\n\n@Yimbymanatee We need to take away the power of these local governments\n\n@MiriVinni @ObeseDoomerGf I think men handle true solitude better than women but that most people need someone in their life and women have way more friends than men, and men often rely on the social circles of women to have friends.\n\n@NickyFrank30 Trump's talent was drawing out a lot of people who were otherwise extremely disinterested in politics. Bernie has the same talent. Can't win a primary with these voters but they are crucial for a general.\n\n@churroallie I thinks it's older men, as well.\n\n@churroallie Not this video but a lot of young men do really feel this sense of a anger and social media contributes to that. And a lot of that anger comes from foreign media.\n\n@churroallie It's possible that the American election was decided by men getting pissed off over an Australian TikTok and voting for Trump.\n\n@Natural_Fallacy @AliceFromQueens Because he was never involved in NY state politics\n\n@Natural_Fallacy @AliceFromQueens I think he intends on running to the right in 2028. But yeah, being from California is gonna be a huge hindrance.\n\n@SeekingReality7 Have an immigration judge. We invented due process for a reason. And I had rather have this hateful bigot here, than give Trump any more power\n\nThis entire line of logic to me is as repulsive to me as red pill. I don't have a moral duty to die for strangers.\n\nGuess I am not a man\n\nNo\n\nArtificial wombs\n\n@NickyFrank30 And the little we do have is working class people agreeing that there are too many immigrants and Democrats are too woke.\n\nGonna be officially married in 24 hours\n\nI would not support detaining them without charge, no.\n\n@thegoodfello The MAGA generation is Gen X. Harris made gains with white boomers.\n\n@goldnecklace2 @TheDryhtscipe @emilykmay There was a case of a Texas man who calculated the economic worth of his wife and said that he would have to pay someone $70k-80k to do what she does for free. And in many cases, most women only want acknowledgement.\n\n@goldnecklace2 Republicans could dilute the backlash. There's a house bill to abolish and the DoE and transfer their popular services like disability funding over to the HHS, but given that, they cannot keep the government open I have no hopes from this GOP majority.\n\n@KevinF_26 @CartoonsHateHer I have almost no social skills and yet I was very well liked in college, always got invited to events. I even get high school reunion calls. I guess I am extremely lucky here. Maybe this is a guy thing, as well.\n\nI have almost no social skills and yet I was very well liked in college, always got invited to events. I even get high school reunion calls. I guess I am extremely lucky here. Maybe this is a guy thing, as well.\n\n@CartoonsHateHer Watching cartoons which I used to watch when I was a child\n\n@bluecolor_dem @StanFdr The planet where most Americans approve of private insurance\n\nThe right hated him for the same reason the left has a hatred of Clarence Thomas. Thomas, black guy who grew up under Jim Crow, should be a liberal but is a card carrying conservative. Conservatives feel like Tim Walz should be a conservative but is a card carrying liberal.\n\nMy best guess is that COVID ruined Dem's polling advantages in education and they don't think the backlash will be large.\n\n@SarkerNotParker Broken clock, blah blah blah\n\nWe have to reinterpret the First Amendment in light of the Internet.\n\n@Danofran Activists push the limits. Politicians will follow. That's how it should be.\n\n@fredzeppelinII They really disliked Dem's stance on illegal immigration\n\nA talented politician doesn't meet the moment of now. He meets the moment of the future. My guess is that Newsom is planning on running to the right of the party in 2028. He will use these three years to remake his brand.\n\nRaging Antisemites also have rights. The First Amendment means that Nazis can also march in Skokie.\n\n@HistoryBoomer This is truly an idiocracy\n\nOh look, she exists\n\n@nobodyknows2322 Research suggests that children are less likely to get injured in the top one because they are more careful\n\n@Scionoobydoo @danieldaycrypto @HacknerTyler @ArmandDoma Shut down the border and asylum. Criminalize illegal entry, hiring and renting to illegal immigrants and mandatory E Verify, would work much better if we had a national identity system.\n\n@CherryC02466949 Daily life is a mild challenge. I can spend hours upon hours in my own world\n\n@CherryC02466949 Like F/T and P/J are pretty tight\n\n@CherryC02466949 I am close to INFP, as well\n\n@CherryC02466949 INTJ\n\n@CatoJrJr @shmr50 @shadihamid So was Ben Gvir\n\n@Sara23_67 @cIairer And prisons. He's much smarter political operator than he lets on. He's trying to restart executions in the state.\n\n@SeekingReality7 You can't arrest people without charge\n\n@thegoodfello @RonFilipkowski He's gonna run on the right in 2028.\n\n@SeekingReality7 Americans desperately need to learn about another genocide\n\nAll the way\n\n@SeekingReality7 Torres?\n\n@JoshMay92136625 @mastasnake176 @death_row0506 @TheMidwesternA1 @deathrowpundit @SkoczSteven Hoffman's stay will likely be lifted by the Supreme Court. No idea about Wood.\n\n@avrilbradley23 I have no idea what his plan here is. Is he planning to run on the right in 2028?\n\nBritain is what happens if California was a country\n\nSay it with me, no such things as too many trains\n\nYou just need a top down solution here. We do put limits on democracy for governance to be possible. And I mean, liberals clearly don't view these states as successful models of governance. More housing is not a losing politics.\n\n@callunas_ @LadyLittleGlass Atheism in Britain began with the working class.\n\nThat's not gonna happen\n\n@bluecolor_dem They don't support trans women in sports or lax border control or soft on crime laws\n\nhttps://t.co/X5oCQ1eoLW\n\n@French_Random06 @TheMidwesternA1 I don't think Conohan has exhausted his appeals\n\nPASS YOUR OWN DAMN RECONCILIATION BILL\n\nWere Jewish college students detained without charge?\n\n@goldnecklace2 @jasonfurman Subsistence farming is working sunup to sundown 6 days a week and then you will maybe have enough to feed yourself\n\n@bluecolor_dem We would be losing every single election. The electorate is not progressive.\n\n@SahilMariners Because you cannot detain people without charge\n\n@goldnecklace2 @jasonfurman And it's always the people who would never work there themselves\n\n@caro Children should be more physically active, boys and girls\n\n@chitowngirl1982 @academic_la Were Saar and Assad lovers?\n\n@chitowngirl1982 @academic_la Men hold on to grudges.\n\nYou cannot detain people without charge. Yes, even assholes. Yes, even raging Antisemites. Do you really want to give Trump this power? What happens when he decides that the people you support are terrorists?\n\nOh shut up\n\n@churroallie I do agree that there are a lot more votes to be gained by moving to the right on social issues than moving to the right on fiscal issues. But Democrats desperately need to fix the housing crisis in blue states. And just fix the sclerosis that blue states seem to have.\n\n@churroallie On crime, Dems have to somehow signal to voters that they think retribution is a legitimate function of penal policy and that the interest of the law abiding must always be put over the interest of the criminal. On immigration, citizens must be more important than illegal aliens\n\n@churroallie Trump radically changed Republican politics on the federal level on abortion and entitlements (he is now going back on that) to build a bigger tent. And I feel like Dems are gonna have to move sharply to the right on immigration and crime.\n\n@churroallie You are either gonna have economic conservatism from the ex Republicans or social conservatism from the ex Democrats but you gotta pick one. There are just not enough socially and fiscally liberal people to win elections, especially in the Midwest.\n\n@Gurdur @CathyYoung63 What has he even done? What has he been arrested for? And to strip a green card, you need a criminal conviction of an aggravated felony or approval by an immigration judge. The executive cannot cancel green cards willy - nilly.\n\nHis wife is 8 months and he has been essentially kidnapped by this administration. This is a perfectly legitimate thing to say.\n\n@CathyYoung63 I am increasingly frustrated at the people defending this. Yes, he's not a good guy, Columbia should disciplined. You still cannot arrest people without charge. Saying Antisemitic garbage is 100% protected by the First Amendment. Almost all the time, better to not punish speech.\n\nHe's a permanent resident\n\nYou cannot detain people without charge or trial. I will die on this hill.\n\nYes, he is a shitty human being. He should be expelled from Columbia. You still cannot detain people without charge. The platform of the Democratic party should always include, \n\n\"No one can be detained without charge or trial.\"\n\nRights are for everyone\n\nBut there was a sincere difference in values. That woman very sincerely believed that America should be a nation of white people.\n\n@KathrynPaisner @academic_la If he has committed a crime, indict him and put him before a jury. You cannot arrest people without charge. Habeas corpus is a sacred right. You cannot abrogate it in peace time.\n\nUnpopular people also have rights\n\nBroadly speaking, arresting people without charge is draconian and his wife is 8 months pregnant. There's no use to any of this.\n\n@SeekingReality7 You cannot imprison people without trial or charge. I don't want to sympathise with that dude, but free speech protections are paramount. If he has committed a crime, haul him before a court of law. If he has not, set him free.\n\n@churroallie You need these ex Republicans because rural Minnesota is swinging right. Even the Iron Range has fallen.\n\n@bepbidini He did do better than Biden with white voters. She utterly collapsed with Hispanic and Asians.\n\n@bluecolor_dem This is really not gonna work. Civil libertarianism has no purchase in America.\n\n@alyraejepsen What also screwed over Democrats was state abortion initiatives. A bunch of people voted for Trump and voted to protect abortion in their states. Voting D was no longer necessary to protect abortion\n\n@alyraejepsen He literally had the Republican party kick out a commitment to a federal abortion ban which has been there since 1980."
