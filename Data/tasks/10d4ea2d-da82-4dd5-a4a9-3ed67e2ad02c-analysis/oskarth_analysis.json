Plenty of people are unable or unwilling to travel to USA. The world is much bigger than NYC/USA, despite what its people think. https://t.co/O7n6jbQ51L\n\n@aisconnolly @nicksvyaznoy @audreyt @jbaylina @JulianAssange_ @santisiri @post_polar_ I’d just reply here\n\nOP is a very abbreviated tweet of talk I gave earlier\n\n@secparam @alinush407 I wrote this with this specific audience in mind :)\n\nhttps://t.co/bnv4i6RoLN\n\nDeliberately doesn't cover polynomials though, but I'll build more intuition on this in the next part\n\nNot just UK and Sweden, France now too\n\nThese law proposals never seem to die, every few years some crackpot politician wants to add another backdoor \"wouldn't it be nice if we could listen in on the bad people? brilliant idea!\" smh\n\nhttps://t.co/jNxFqxnclq\n\nThis seems... fragile"
