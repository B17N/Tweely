I will delete it. I just think it’s a bad profile picture. It does not read well, and has no warmth whatsoever.\n\n@borgesbigot777 :3\n\n@WillJColeridge @AngusJBA oh my god it is not a negative opinion on appearance, just that this isn’t the best pfp\n\n@ajamesba_ It is a below average visual representation of you\n\n@ajamesba_ Change it!!\n\nBro doesn’t want real feedback 😤😤\n\n@lethalluz OMG CONGRATULATIONS\n\n@borgesbigot777 Ancestry\n\n@enderclops @arithmoquine heck i’m male and i hate my body hair, shit’s tough\n\n(Cept for my legs and arms, that’s reasonable)\n\n@9chabard @arithmoquine Yeah, this\n\nBro’s job is tweeting\n\n@MILLENIALCHASER oh hi\n\n@originalwololo goddamnit why must he be hot\n\n@PradyuPrasad Hi\n\n@linkbutalt “Comrade? Alert Zhdanov. The word must be passed on to the artists, the twink doesn’t want sad endings.”\n\n@yourfriendmarcy @microwave_user Yes, and also really really fast\n\n@Trey_Explainer Ah. Well, go watch Andrei Rublev anyhow. (If you please)\n\n@Trey_Explainer Possible the artist’s intent was revisionist. Anyway, go watch Andrei Rublev, top ten movie all time\n\nhttps://t.co/EFWfercpgR\n\n@Trey_Explainer This is an episode in Andrei Rublev. I do not think you should think the painter is literal.\n\n@janonacct @Noahpinion ^-^ thank you anonymous tech bro who i have definitely never seen before ^-^\n\n@Noahpinion I have!! The only thing I ever do is “read the literature” lol\n\nalso you should follow me\n\nhttps://t.co/kNpRqlXmkB\n\nTo be clear, detaining people because of their views is pretty bad\n\n@neipate96 @MichaelSFBA Somebody garbled it\n\n@cheer_wine She’s so cool\n\n@neipate96 @MichaelSFBA https://t.co/AuJs1XYhov\n\n@jaketropolis @atlanticesque https://t.co/tl7gKMxB64\n\n@aarmlovi I would not be so confident in ascribing intent ^-^\n\n@jonasfrombk Am I?\n\nso how did basically none of y’all interpret this as a criticism of anti-trust law?\n\n@microwave_user Thank you ma’am\n\n@yourfriendmarcy @microwave_user It is an observation without moral valence. Noting an inconsistency does not say which side we should change!\n\nE.g. saying a tax should be equal between two groups does not say whether it should be the higher or the lower one.\n\n@falanouc With apologies, I did not intend to.\n\n@moshpitsister @145k4 I only describe the world. I am not prescribing anything.\n\n@JP_Halll @foxyavelli We have pragmatically recognized that death is sufficient grounds for divorce. There may be people, however, who would prefer to know that their spouse remain unable to marry after their death, or that they might die together.\n\n@foxyavelli When someone dies, and the partner remarries, the partner is leaving the marriage because the other person is providing unsatisfactory services. Thus, one must provide enough that the person does not prefer to leave.\n\n@marilynmaupin @pissmarck This is extremely insulting, and you should update your mental model of me.\n\n@foxyavelli But you are, I’m afraid. Do you think if you died they would remain with you? (Dying is a serious dereliction of your marital duties).\n\n@rajm2016 @145k4 “If you don’t do this, I will break up with you”. \n\nIf partners have unequal bargaining power, this need not lead us to the optimal outcome.\n\nI’m curious if some of y’all think that people shouldn’t be allowed to give away their ability to divorce, under any circumstances. It is well-known (see Maskin-Tirole) that there are some contractual structures optimal only if you can prevent renegotiation! So why not?\n\n@mandalynns23 @feral__mama ^-^\n\n@DunhamBrennan @stanfordNYC It’s unfortunate that twitter is not incentive compatible 😞😞\n\n@RichardMorrison Everyone above 400 pounds gets split into two 200 pound firms\n\n@colorhedge The slight to academic quality is reasonable, and I won’t argue against it\n\nGo read my blog! Today I covered the work of the economist Chad Jones. I feel inspired by the clarity of his work.\n\nhttps://t.co/690IAISaGc\n\n@stanfordNYC Yeah. And I see someone insisting on strict monogamy while dating as trying to raise the cost of exiting.\n\n@colorhedge Condemning the tweet on that basis is really weird. Ordinary GMU practice is a vulgar price theory, where market power basically doesn’t exist and all contracts get us closer to the social optimum. Like, it shows that you really don’t understand what you’re criticizing.\n\n@ratlimit how could i have forgotten to cite the prior literature\n\n@ratlimit Thanks referee no. 2\n\n@stanfordNYC That makes sense. Then the ideal solution is you can’t bar outside contact until there are large and indivisible investments made.\n\n@linkbutalt Don’t tell a friend of mine (and more importantly, don’t tell either of the companies he works for)\n\n@Lib_Development I disagree. There’s a lot to be said for antitrust action generally.\n\n@_jannalulu @stanfordNYC You can’t make causal conclusions from observational data\n\n@borgesbigot777 @realKnowtify I always knew you were a true ally\n\n@HowIMineFish How’s this libertarian?\n\n@rpmm24 Yes; every one except the one you happen to be reading\n\n@stanfordNYC Partners lack commitment power\n\nI am also skeptical that guarantees of monogamy would actually meaningfully increase investment. What exactly do you mean by investment?\n\n@theojaffee That isn’t vandalism\n\n@borgesbigot777 How????\n\n@nikicaga wtf\n\n49 million views??\n\n@145k4 People can have heterogenous switching costs. Anyhow, since there are switching costs at all we shouldn’t expect people to be perfectly matched\n\n@145k4 But what if one partner has better outside options? If the partner exploits their market power, we should not expect to be at the social optimum.\n\nRequiring monogamy from your partner seems an awful lot like anti-competitive behavior we would frown upon in any other context.\n\nEnescu’s “Oedipe” has to be one of the most underrated operas of all time. Absolutely fantastic.\n\n@MiniUlisse Go walk somewhere else to work. Don’t work in a place where you do other things. It really does help.\n\nhttps://t.co/690IAISaGc Go read it!\n\nGo read my blogpost today!! (Link below). I survey the work of Chad Jones, one of the great economists of our time. https://t.co/cWxWBmO2Ju\n\n@adam_messinger Ideally we’d have no tax on capital gains, which is what a wealth tax is\n\n@Liv_Agar OMG WILL\n\n@LeetAlpaca3 Yes\n\nNow that we have thoroughly established that tariffs are bad, may we please consider how income taxes are bad too? :3 https://t.co/dRlgmymzMo\n\n@hgh_hazel Fuck em up Hazel\n\nFriend isn’t taking the end of the Middle Ages well https://t.co/7GAI1R40lv\n\n@arithmoquine Don’t get sussed henry!!\n\n@145k4 well good thing that i’m not an egg — hypothetically speaking, of course\n\n@145k4 hypothetically, what i were younger and a grad student\n\n@HughWil16634342 I suspect you made a typo. In any event, I cannot find it.\n\n@borgesbigot777 You have no idea…\n\n@borgesbigot777 How about h-index?\n\n@ptrschmdtnlsn I haven’t seen a serious attempt to measure how much of the social surplus traders capture\n\nShe let me pluck the ticks from behind her ear where she can’t reach, very mutualistic relationship\n\nI’m a disney princess btw https://t.co/XOjjfVvsSs\n\n@flizzyclone GOD i wish\n\nSandro (@neocentrist) argues that a supply shock will reduce the natural rate of interest, counterbalancing the increase in inflation. Thus it only constrains the bank if they make an error, and misestimate the amount of M needed. This seems true, to me. My original post may be in error.\n\n@arithmoquine My intuition is that you remove the part controlling one of your eyes. You have lessened function, but it’s very clear what will happen, and you’ll still have sight.\n\n@ShaiRinku What’s this from?\n\n@philosophypet Congratulations!\n\nhttps://t.co/eMvmqDxHQC I’m open to narrowly targeted restrictions on particular people, but must come out strongly against these hammer like regulations. We shouldn’t even expect it to redistribute to the poor — it would worsen inequality.\n\nCapping interest rates would be a profound mistake. On my blog today, I argue that not only is the empirical evidence against it, it would bind the hands of the Fed and turn negative supply shocks into recessions. Link below — please share if you want people to read this! https://t.co/xW3dGTUEpL\n\n@borgesbigot777 You’re so brave\n\n@SolInvi24645112 @kingofthecoastt Yes\n\n@145k4 I had a long, econ-jargony answer ready as a joke, but then I realized it didn’t actually make sense\n\nAnyway, yes, of course you are, very much so\n\n@145k4 NYC is so glamorous\n\n@goingawoll Finally, “twink” being used to describe people who are actually twinks\n\n@RPShah_econ @ZachariahSchwab @ATabarrok @AEAInformation Without data, it would be impossible to say if Asians are discriminated against.\n\nYou can tell that Wikipedia is edited by unemployed people from how many biographies of Post-Keynesians there are.\n\n@RPShah_econ @ZachariahSchwab @ATabarrok @AEAInformation One might be interested in measuring discrimination. That is a perfectly good field of inquiry.\n\n@RPShah_econ @ATabarrok @AEAInformation I may not have been clear in what I want. I think that sort of information should be publicly available, and all the AEA should have to do is look it up in a very large spreadsheet.\n\nThis will be profoundly bad. Read why on my blog, tomorrow.\n\n@RiverTamYDN Underrated how much tiredness screws up your shot\n\n@BlatantlyDumb @ATabarrok @AEAInformation As stands now, since states are in charge of births, deaths, and marriages, other agencies have literally no idea what you have unless they ask you.\n\n@BlatantlyDumb @ATabarrok @AEAInformation Ideally, you would take one super survey, and then the AEA doesn’t have to ask — you just provide your identification, and they have all the records searchable. It’s only our misguided emphasis on privacy which leads us to take so many surveys.\n\n@BlatantlyDumb @ATabarrok @AEAInformation Yes? I’m quite clear that I think there should be a government database on everything under the sun.\n\nhttps://t.co/9OlDE1HD0F\n\n@BenShindel The current state of the laptop https://t.co/eRrQdkBDDw\n\n@ATabarrok @AEAInformation This seems perfectly reasonable to me. My preference is for datasets to have comprehensive information.\n\nWell, I wrote it. I think part of the intimidation is how good a writer he is — it’s *clear*. Every paper he’s written is beautifully explained.\n\n@Ian_Gay_briel The market isn’t failing, though. It is providing precisely what people demand. Food deserts are a demand-side problem, and simply providing healthier options won’t move consumption patterns substantially.\n\n@enderclops wow, you’re telling me for the first time\n\n@linkbutalt Yeah. People have to hack away at the parts of the problem which are solvable.\n\n@lethalluz hii\n\n@enderclops “I’ll take ‘things that don’t surprise me’ for a thousand, Alex”\n\n@felpix_ It’s a pretty clear way to elucidate what he has in mind 😭😭\n\nhttps://t.co/kdyPWhB1qJ You can read the whole thing here.\n\nI thought these remarks from Pete Klenow on the role of macroeconomics in development to be extremely compelling. https://t.co/mWvO4kjEGA\n\n@1avenza meow\n\n@indiraschka @parafactual @lukalot_ isn’t trade beautiful?\n\n@circularliz You’re absolutely right, I did not expect that\n\n@circularliz Please spare me having to watch the video\n\n@GarettJones It’s just proto Stiglitz-Weiss\n\nBeen writing Wikipedia pages for economists. Chad Jones is the first one who I’ve felt scared to approach — his work is so broadly important that I feel as though I were trying to climb up a sheer cliff.\n\n@purplewaves7 Now break perfect information. Lenders offer one rate. If no markups, necessarily worse for all; if markups, it could be welfare enhancing. \n\nSome work you might find interesting: https://t.co/eE5Nn9GImD\n\n@purplewaves7 So let’s work through some examples. Our base case is perfect information, and P=MC. Here price caps reduce welfare for all individuals. Now introduce markups. Then it could increase welfare, though this depends on the exact level of the cap and the distribution of risk.\n\n@scheminglunatic hater\n\n@neocasarvatism @purplewaves7 You would need to know the markups to fully know.\n\n@JLawndragon @purplewaves7 God forbid I’m *actually* in favor of legalizing drugs!\n\n@bridemoder @purplewaves7 Johnny Cash is plainly not celebrating violence in “Folsom Prison Blues”. Read the lyrics! He profoundly regrets what he did.\n\nMy most conservative opinion is that I think troubadour culture is really, really bad, and leads to pointless warfare and the slaughter of peasants.\n\nJust look at its influence on impressionable young boys. Is this what we want our culture to celebrate? https://t.co/mSaiWfZRc4\n\n@bridemoder @purplewaves7 I’m not afraid of rap music. I simply think celebrating violence is bad, especially when acting on it is plausible.\n\nFor the same reasons, I would have thought that troubadour culture was very bad in 14th century France.\n\n@purplewaves7 You cannot actually say it would benefit poor people without more information on the distribution of risk through the population, and how well banks can tell customers apart. It is trivially easy to construct examples where this lowers welfare for poor consumers.\n\nEligibility rules for sports leagues is something which governments have no business dealing with. Each league should make their own rules.\n\n@originalwololo Yes, but shave you hillbilly\n\n@hgh_hazel proo-\n\n@hgh_hazel you look really good\n\n@IMAO_ Great album, but fundamentally a concept album — the stage setting was an optional extra.\n\nThis seems elegant, and an obvious improvement.\n\n@Ancapta @AnniePosting @girltwinkneolib 88 — um, problematic much?\n\n@Ancapta @AnniePosting @girltwinkneolib Would you do it for me?\n\n@Ancapta @AnniePosting @girltwinkneolib The first statement was ETETETET/ETETET, and the second one clearly ZE VT\n\nThese messages may be further encrypted Annie\n\n@demiurgently @milken_cookies It’s more than that, at least for stronger ones. You push where the sounds are coming from forward in your mouth, and use more of the tip of your tongue.\n\n@Ancapta @AnniePosting @girltwinkneolib Use your words, Rachel\n\n@arithmoquine waow\n\n@pzoch5 They counting class participation 😭😭 (in two at least)\n\nI legitimately wish I didn’t have to take classes. They’re making me learn less than if I had just spent the time as I usually do, in the library.\n\n@pollsockpuppet6 @linkbutalt Perfect angels, every one ^-^\n\n@BamaExpat @behavinbehavin Selection. Also you’ll have difficulty getting a sample\n\n@heichoustan You always look so happy. Positively overjoyed. Must be the beautiful weather.\n\n@kchoudhu Unbelievable levels of “making up a guy”\n\n@EntropyChase @kchoudhu You’d do well to read what I wrote, and actually think through what it means\n\nAlso, Obama is black but he is not Black, and this shouldn’t be controversial\n\n@linkbutalt Remember, women are an inscrutable bunch of aliens"
