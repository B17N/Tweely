Stańczak and provide a summary of what they mainly talked about in the past week:\n\n@0xpeternguyen after the official start date\n\nAfter the whole day talking about agents on Ethereum during the d/acc day. Continue by building.\n\nExecution layer client teams - do you think it would be all fine to target 100 Mgas blocks on L1 by the end of year?\n\nConsensus layer client teams - any challenges with reorgs?\n\nCommunity - bad or good idea?\n\nL2s - what are your Mgas/s (or equivalent) targets\n\nMany people want to hear more about the future, trade-offs, work being done around the L1 - L2 relarionship. Reading all the comments (calmly with open mind) under the Dankrad's tweet and the nested discussion will bring you some answers and some more questions.\n\nhttps://t.co/gHn8nm19FK\n\nThere is a lot of work related to institutional adoption but there is also lots of play and experimentation on ethereum. We build financial systems, we build governance systems, and we also build the world's Factorios - gardens, factories, space exploration, labs. Join teams building worlds with ethereum.\n\n@Yeethereum_ Interop it back.\n\nStrength of all L2s combined. Ethereum economy.\n\nBuilding networks, building bridges. Ethereum Economy, innovations from L2s. @Starknet\n\n@BullAdamJonas @elonmusk Should organize Olympics there\n\n@peter_szilagyi Because you made it too famous\n\nTotally personal, not holding any, I did speak to @infiniteyay about projects together but have not even started yet as it is all explorations. Really like these. Onchain, AI, NFTs. Ethereum made it all possible.\n\nHow to build your local Ethereum community\n\n@Taran_ss It has a lot of great stories that have the favour aspect central to the character interactions.\n\n@Taran_ss https://t.co/heoTBmG2VZ\n\n@goyatty @tkstanczak\n\n@theweifarer I haven't started yet, 17th or 24th\n\nMe responding to your Telegram messages\n\n@gakonst @yoavw @frangio_ Public mempool is needed for CR (censorship resistance) and protection against traceability as well as provision of deniable source of origin. Public mempool is part of the CR tooling on Ethereum. It does not have to deliver any substantial part of the blockspace.\n\n@MtHenye Spontaneous\n\nI will be in London this evening only if somehow someone wants to waste their Saturday evening for work.\n\nHappy to meet around 8 / 9 pm in Canary Wharf."
