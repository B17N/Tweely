Crypto is still seen as a casino for degens. If we don‚Äôt build real positive-sum apps that add value to the world that reputation will stick and it will be deserved. It‚Äôs now or never\nhttps://t.co/ldTM4Vty25\n\n@uttam_singhk Laughing at the TikTok style. Well done üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª\n\nI get the point, ETH‚Äôs value isn‚Äôt summed up in a single slogan. I personally like the old bankless triple point asset thesis\n\nETH is valuable because it‚Äôs a store of value, a capital asset, and a consumable resource all at once. It secures Ethereum, powers its economy, and is integrated into its financial system\n\nI already see the response coming that this isn‚Äôt a north star, but a single, rigid purpose isn‚Äôt what makes ETH valuable imo. We might just agree to disagree on that\n\nETH has multiple demand drivers, like other major assets. Stocks gain value from ownership, dividends, speculation, etc each weighing differently\n\nETH sees demand from holding, staking, economic collateral, & fees. I roughly agree with polynya on the weights\n\nPeople at the EF don‚Äôt have a uniform stance. Everyone has their own opinions\n\n@mteamisloading Agreed on the latter. There's a bunch of different demand drivers for ETH and I think @apolynya lays them out really well in this post\nhttps://t.co/3abCksFCLt\n\n33:29\nhttps://t.co/YGwPtJvJOg\n\n\"Some say Ethereum lacks a clear North Star. That‚Äôs misunderstanding at best, propaganda at worst\n\nEthereum‚Äôs goal is clear: scale to millions while preserving openness, censorship resistance &amp; privacy\n\nThe first decade was an experiment. The second is real adoption.\"\n\n ‚Äì VB\n\n@B0R444 I loled well done\n\nApps https://t.co/Xify5ujW4W\n\nThe infra is ready. Uncle Sam has backed off. No more excuses.\n\nIt‚Äôs time to go mainstream.\n\nApps.\n\n@html_tina Love this\n\n@pulkit__singh Yes you absolutely can, will read it later thanks for sharing\n\nIf you come across an interesting Ethereum project, whether it‚Äôs a library, dashboard, tool, or anything else, tag me\n\nI want to see it, check it out, and help give it more exposure\n\n@ec265 @feelmybicep @soundxyz_ That was beautiful\n\nAnother banger added to my music collection\n\nJust became the #5 backer of Glue from @feelmybicep on @soundxyz_\nhttps://t.co/sR8J0eFMvZ"
