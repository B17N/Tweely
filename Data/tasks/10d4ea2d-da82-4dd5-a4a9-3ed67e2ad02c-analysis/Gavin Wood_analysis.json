It is not especially helpful to misrepresent a sophisticated protocol like Elves.\n\nElves uses cryptographically-secure random verifiable sampling together with escalation-by-default. Basically, all nodes execute everything *unless* it can be proven statistically impossible that the work report is incorrect. Because we have a closed system with clear probabilities we can model this accurately, and in practice nodes only need to execute about 1/30th of the total work most of the time. Finality happens only when >2/3 of validators agree that there is no chance of any historical work reports being invalid.\n\n@ET90266 @alice_und_bob I would not. We need missionaries, not mercenaries.\n\n@phil_uplc All computation done for DOOM was run on JAM. If you’re still unsure after reading the Gray Paper, feel free to ask in the JAM Chat room on Matrix or come to any one of my presentations on JAM and I’d be happy to explain in greater detail."
