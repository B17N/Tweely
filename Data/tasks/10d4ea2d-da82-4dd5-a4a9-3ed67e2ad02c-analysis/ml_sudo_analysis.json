From a single prompt ‚Äúcreate a DocuSign clone‚Äù\n\nAre y‚Äôall crazy or wat\n\n@PatrickAlphaC @safe Yeah I did not understand that point\n\nV: how do you make open source work with your business model? \n\nPanelists:\n* it‚Äôs very hard, trying to figure it out \n* George hotz strategy of selling something for more than it costs\n* open source itself is not a moat. Need to figure it out\n* marine biology has the concept of a whale fall: when a fall passes, its carcass creates a massive beautiful ecosystem, catalyses things that couldn‚Äôt exist otherwise - my fav take \n\nVitalik makes a joke about ‚Äúcrypto whales‚Äù answering the call to fall üòÜ \n\n@johnsonmxe @VitalikButerin @gaoist @microbeminded2\n\n@badcryptobitch The girl on right is alive\n\nNo matter how secure your custody‚Ä¶ diversification matters\n\nCredit to the d/acc day team who brought in 22 air filters into the auditorium.

I made the stone oven, but the pizza tray is too large to fit into the opening of the oven. I hack at the opening until the tray fits. Then I find out that I forgot to leave enough room for the fire.\n\nOkay. https://t.co/rAAo6Wk5Cf\n\nü§£ whoever this founder is, she is my hero hahahah\n\n@P3b7_ @lightclients @Ledger One more question - is there a page that says which Dapps have registered for Clear Signing? \n\nI'd like to do a demo of the difference between apps that have and those that haven't\n\n@P3b7_ @lightclients @Ledger Is there a video guide on Dapps would use this to register their contracts?\n\nI searched for Ledger Clear Signing and didn't find much more than announcement blogs.\n\nif you abandon global competition and global leadership ‚Äî you shut down American Empire, and with it the ability to print money. And then everyone in that empire has a very bad time.\n\n@P3b7_ @lightclients @Ledger @ethereumfndn @tkstanczak @Rabby_io @MetaMask @Uniswap @aave @_SEAL_Org Meanwhile, @P3b7_ please see this list of asks for hardware wallets by @PatrickAlphaC @CyfrinAudits \n\nhttps://t.co/RNOBwHVSdM\n\nExciting\n\nLoved this walk through of a fork of @pcaversaccio's safe hashes tool by @PatrickAlphaC @CyfrinAudits\n\nHe used @Trezor @Ledger @KeystoneWallet in the demo. I have listed the wallets in increasing order of ability to check what you are actually signing. \n\nBasically, don't use Trezor, Ledger may be acceptable if you don't mind doing more work, while Keystone leads the pack.\n\nI'd like to highlight his succinctly phrased request to hardware wallets below: \n\n===\n\nDear Hardware Wallets: I have a couple of asks for you. \n\n#1 you should all add clear \nsigning like what we saw with the \nKeystone wallet so that I can directly see what was \ngoing on with my transaction without having to\nintegrate with something like metamask\n\n#2 it would be cool if we could export the call data so that we could match it to the tools that we write e.g.  add a QR code that allows us to scan it so we can import into where we use our tools \n\n#3 [that being said,] scanning QR codes is very spooky so maybe there's something more clever that you can do\n\n#4 and if you do do a QR code have it be like a base 64 in code so you could work in offline mode\n\n#5 additionally it would be cool if you showed the hash of the call data because that would be much easier to spot check than the entire call data \n\nprivate key attacks are the number one attack Vector from last year and they're looking like they're going\nto be the number one attack vector going forward\n\nhttps://t.co/av2YbrRIe3\n\n@P3b7_ @lightclients @Ledger How does the industry as a whole apply pressure on dApps to integrate clear signing?\n\n@ethereumfndn @tkstanczak @Rabby_io @MetaMask @Uniswap @aave @_SEAL_Org\n\nI'm just tagging leading apps and wallets, no idea if they've already integrated clear signing\n\n@lightclients Hi @Ledger @P3b7_ what happened to the June 2024 no-blind signing goal, which you announced in December 2023? \n\nWhich parts of the industry do you need to cooperate with you to get it done?\n\n@lightclients did they explain why? did something like a new EIP standard make it more difficult, or is it just the usual \"software delays\" reason?\n\nDid Ledger \"end blind signing for Eth dApps\" by June 2024? \n\nThis was from a December 2023 article\n\nhttps://t.co/LCYrLrZdh9 https://t.co/lwCJD6Hm0v\n\n@diro_opinion @CPerezz19 @zashi_app Sorry yes, my bad, too much rapid finger typing\n\n.@CPerezz19, u inspire me with your backbone and support \n\nZcash with only 1 year runway: https://t.co/hfFgUuqsWC\n\nAside: on the flip side, would be funny if zoomer crypto devs choose a proxy for real life needs and the proxy gets very confused at the constant barrage of instructions\n\nI struggled to understand upgradable contracts in Ethereum, and the word ‚Äúproxy‚Äù was a big reason why.\n\nIn law, a proxy HAS agency‚Äîit makes decisions on someone‚Äôs behalf. If I \"appoint a proxy\" to vote on my behalf as a shareholder of a public company, I let them vote however they decide is best. If I ‚Äúappoint a healthcare proxy,‚Äù I let them make decisions for me if I am unfit or unconscious.\n\nBut in Ethereum, a proxy contract HAS NO agency‚Äîit blindly forwards calls to an implementation contract using delegatecall.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt EVM devs‚Äô fault. The term proxy comes from network computing, where a proxy server relays requests without modifying them. The same idea applies to EVM proxies‚Äîthey forward calls but don‚Äôt execute logic.\n\nOnce I realized this, proxy/upgradable contracts finally clicked! Took too long. \n\nLet's be better about etymology, so we onboard as many ppl as quickly as possible\n\n.@Google removed International Women's Day (8 March) from their cultural calendar\n\nI know they are trying to erase DEI\n\nBut IWD predates DEI by 100 years (first celebrated in 1911)\n\nhi Google, Sundar, are u okay?\n\nare you going to bind women's feet too (which officially ended in 1912)?\n\nhttps://t.co/ymBkyeOIpT\n\nhttps://t.co/EjfWY3inGl\n\n@calilyliu Women like you and I are loud and can challenge a guy toe to toe in business.\n\nI‚Äôve started to have empathy for women who aren‚Äôt cursed/gifted with this force of personality so sometimes I like to speak out in the hopes of opening a wedge for them.\n\nZcash rebirthing‚Ä¶"
