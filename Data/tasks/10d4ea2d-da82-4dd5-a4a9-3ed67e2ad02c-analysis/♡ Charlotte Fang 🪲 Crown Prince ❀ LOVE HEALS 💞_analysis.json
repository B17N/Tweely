It's an old contention with milady, remilio was partly in response to that energy, to give a space for trader and shitcoiner types that were getting attacked by purists. Remilia is a bigger umbrella than just milady and also bigger than crypto as an industry. We're building the new internet and milady is one cultural pillar.\n\nI don‚Äôt do PR. You‚Äôre mixing up positioning for short/mid term PA with a debate over long term execution towards aligned decentralized values. I do believe in the goal of a world computer; I tempered my opinion on the ICO fork and came around to ETH prior to their recognition of milady after speaking to developers closely involved and also after getting to understand the low levels of sincerity and short time horizons of the other teams building ‚Äúalternatives‚Äù. I still maintain some caution if they truly will execute on the goals they‚Äôve set out to, but I‚Äôm much more convinced on their sincerity in trying. This is not the same thing traders focused on their short/mid term price performance are worried about though, and it‚Äôs not any advocation on those bets. I‚Äôm also not a hardline maxi, I‚Äôve argued all volume flooding into decentralized markets is good overall for the goals of the space; the positioning debate between chains is primarily about risks & time horizons which is informed by the idealism, defensibility & alignment debates that place ETH on top among its competitors‚Äîof which BTC is not one. BTC solves an entirely different goal than ETH, people contrasting the two are just thinking of them in terms of bags.\n\n@StakedSatoshi likely drainer. there are things going on in that domain but milady has fair use as VPL and they would know that\n\nhttps://t.co/2ULb7M9Uty"

  "summary": "The tweets from @‚ô° Charlotte Fang ü™≤ Crown Prince ‚ùÄ LOVE HEALS üíû in the past week mainly discuss topics related to the concept of \"milady\" and its role within the crypto community, particularly in relation to values, principles, and the ETH ecosystem. The tweets also touch on the idea of using \"milady\" as a cultural pillar and discuss the positioning debate between different chains in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, there are mentions of forgiveness, the consideration of official merch featuring \"punished milady,\" and references to the use of \"milady\" in different contexts. The overall sentiment appears to be focused on discussing and exploring the significance of \"milady\" within the crypto community and how it aligns with decentralized values and goals.",
