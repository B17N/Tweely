    "user": "Please analyze these tweets from @Richard Ngo and provide a summary of what they mainly talked about in the past week:\n\n@tszzl @ShakeelHashim honestly I think \"different views\" is actually a bit too charitable. the default for people who self-select into PR-type work is to optimize for influence without even trying to have consistent object-level beliefs (especially about big \"sci-fi\" topics like AGI)\n\n@waltuuuhr I don't care that much about profiting from this.\n\nI'm mostly interested in someone tackling the editing + logistics + marketing.\n\nI could either hire someone to do this, or sign with a publisher. The latter seems like it'd work better if I can swing it.\n\n@jonatanpallesen @GarettJones idk I think it's actually pretty surprising and noteworthy. it broke my world-model a bit because I expected it to be, like, 5x lower than the rate of native Germans becoming doctors\n\nwonder if this is mostly a fact about western doctor training constraints?\n\nThere are very few fiction writers who deeply understand AGI, which is why I'm excited about releasing my stories more widely.\n\nYou can read most of them at https://t.co/Nrz5v1uzAX (though I also have 6 I haven't released yet).\n\ncc @hannu, @AndrewMayne, @_TamaraWinter for leads.\n\nOver the last two years I've written about 30 sci-fi short stories, mostly about post-AGI futures.\n\nI'd now like to release some of these stories as a book.\n\nDM me if you can intro me to a publisher who might be interested, and/or might want to help me edit + self-publish them.\n\n@GarettJones What’s 0.6% meant to imply? Is it a surprisingly low rate of becoming doctors?\n\n@TylerAlterman Consider coming to one of these (or helping host one)!\n\n@Aria_Babu list three dark EAs?\n\nhttps://t.co/cajVfp9Qzw\n\nNew story, inspired by @qntm's Antimemetics Division and adversarial machine learning.\n\nLink below. https://t.co/jZ8lj2w4LO\n\n@GarrisonLovely @juddrosenblatt (To clarify, I think dismantling USAID in general significantly advances his political goals, but dismantling PEPFAR in particular doesn’t.)\n\n@GarrisonLovely @juddrosenblatt the structure of your argument is way off\n\nyou have gone from saying \"if he cares about safety why isn't he doing anything?\" to \"if he cares about safety why did he do this one particular thing I dislike?\"\n\nbut nobody's saying that *everything* he does is strategic\n\nOh, I think I misinterpreted your previous tweet - I thought you meant you were open to changing your mind in any specific case, but now it seems like you meant you’re open to changing your mind about your overall view on her.\n\nI don’t actually want to debate about AOC though, I left the comment because I thought you might reply with something that helped clarify where we disagree (like “yeah I think AOC is one of the most principled American politicians” or “no I actually think most politicians are principled”).\n\n@HumanHarlan On 1, because it is extremely hard to do stuff working only (or primarily) in a molecular-level ontology, it’s much more natural to focus on macroscopic concepts.\n\nOn 2, because there’s a lot of room between “smarter than humans” and “superintelligent”.\n\n@catehall in this case you call it your “operating model” which suggests you think it’s usually the right stance to take\n\n@catehall woah that’s a really bold assumption to make about *any* politician, let alone one who’s so good at PR + takes fairly extreme positions\n\nTo be clear, my original tweet was only meant as an objection against one particular threat model - and not even the one most alignment researchers focus on.\n\n@JimDMiller Yeah I agree, I didn’t mean to include “fill the universe with compute” as an example of what I was describing in the original tweet.\n\nThe paperclip maximizer scenario was always about paperclip-like objects being terminally valued.\n\n@lumpenspace Most alignment researchers don’t focus on the paper clipping threat model, they focus on disempowerment threat models (in a way which is fairly agnostic about what AIs will do with the world after gaining control of it).\n\nIn other words: just as we’ll try to align AIs much smarter than us, so too will they try to align AIs much smarter than them.\n\nThe weak version of this claim is just that they’ll put effort into it, and they’ll likely do a better job than us. That by itself seems sufficient to make paperclip maximizers implausible.\n\nBut there’s also a strong version of the claim: if this is a recurring problem across generations, then sufficiently intelligent agents will identify protocols for cooperation which help solve it.\n\nIt’s inefficient for each generation to distrust its descendants. A universe in which all intelligences behave cooperatively towards the (much stupider and less coherent) agents which gave rise to them is a universe which reaps huge gains from trade across time.\n\nI don’t think this makes such cooperation inevitable, no more than the idea of war being irrational reliably prevents war. But it does suggest that we should be on the look out for protocols that apply even across big intelligence gaps, and try to instill them into our AIs.\n\nI recently gave a talk inspired by this idea, on the analogy between how humans should treat animals, how parents should treat children, and how AIs should treat us. Will upload in a few days. I also think that updateless decision theory is relevant here, as one of the few formal treatments of interactions between smart and dumb agents. Will say more about this in some forthcoming blog posts.\n\nIt seems unrealistic to me that a superintelligence will tile the universe with small-scale patterns (like paperclips).\n\nNot because it’s an alien goal from a human perspective.\n\nBut because it’s an alien goal from the perspective of its not-yet-superintelligent predecessor AIs.\n\n@LinchZhang this is how liberalism works"

  "summary": "The tweets from @RichardNgo over the past week mainly revolve around topics such as artificial general intelligence (AGI), fiction writing about post-AGI futures, seeking a publisher for his stories, engaging in discussions about dismantling USAID or PEPFAR, debating political figures like AOC, and exploring concepts related to alignment research and superintelligent AI behavior. There are mentions of specific individuals, requests for introductions to publishers, and sharing new stories. The sentiments expressed are a mix of curiosity, interest, critical analysis, and engagement in intellectual discussions.",
