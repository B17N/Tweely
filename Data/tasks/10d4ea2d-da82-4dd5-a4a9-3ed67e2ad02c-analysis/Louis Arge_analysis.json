or like you left it alone for a while and then it popped or something?\n\n@nickcammarata do you know roughly what amount of actively dedicated time 0-3 took for you vs 3-4?\n\n@nickcammarata yess exactly, i meant mctb 4th path!\n\ninteresting to know! how did 0-&gt;3 feel, how did 3-&gt;4 feel?\n\nwhat did you think bodhisattva vow meant? vibes? papers? essays?\n\nwould you rather:\n- have 3rd path (meditative attainment) + be able to contribute significantly to your field of work (whatever that field might be!)\n- have 4th path, but be more limited/modest in your contributions to your field\n\n@DefenderOfBasic @_space_punk_ wait I'm pretty sure QRI believes consciousness is a thing (depending on your definition of thing)\n\ni'd very much put myself in this camp too (although not sold on all QRI theories)\n\nsee this classic: https://t.co/9gSzGfe33S\n\n@arithmoquine @algekalipso @webmasterdave @aaarataki @danielmingram !!!\n\n@grantbels @melodaysong @kasratweets wow wholesome\n\n@JimDMiller good lord almighty üò¨\n\n@_ivyzhang @nickcammarata yes it's 3 huels 1 block of cheese 6 corn tortillas 1 serving of cream potatoes 1 bowl of yoghurt with blueberry jam and peanut butter. don't ask me how i know this\n\n@sinecuris i feel the same &amp; i don't really know what to do about it. also i suspect that the feeling is mostly a delusion that will go away by the time someone new feels as magical to a future Louis as She did to that particular past Louis. let's see ü™∑\n\n@PhaentGames noted! i've not spoken to anyone who has had loss of magic at all iirc (in the way i've heard it described, not purely the personal growth sense; since i've spoken to you haha!)\n\n@brimmingvessel this is such a cool fact\n\n@alexislearning frankly my diet is just super high protein already &amp; i'm like 62kg &amp; if i don't cut down on protein i'm gonna have kidney damage\n\n@KennethFolk do you believe there are no free lunches? in my mind any improvement of any process is a free lunch, at least as seen from the perspective of someone who only had the old way\n\n@PhaentGames woah! would be crazy if loss of magic was actually a positive thing, indicating the work is now done ü§Ø\n\nalthough it is my impression that there are some people who do not feel this way &amp; simply don't get much effect from mdma anymore\n\n@Levi7hart \"lose the magic\" refers to the fact that MDMA seemingly get's permanently less potent with each user, and after some number of uses you can't really feel it anymore\n\n@ganjamarchindia interesting. thank you for your contribution to science!\n\nhow would you describe your experience of j2? &amp; would you naturally make Ulisse's analogy to mdma or not?\n\n@nadiainthought here's a post i really liked in this genre: https://t.co/ptHVZL8GfZ\n\nif J2 = MDMA, that has interesting empathogen-safety implications\n\ndoes anyone know of anyone who:\n- has taken MDMA enough times to completely \"lose the magic\"\n- learned to do jhana 2 successfully\n\n@ZerothAxiom cooked me üò≠\n\n@EricShawnE79 @vibepreserver @elysian_labs not really, i bet it's a really valuable app bc people seem to like it\n\n@ZerothAxiom how do I bet on a negative percentage\n\n@rajlearns which post? &amp; i'm curious if you can say more about what you mean by information architecture?\n\n@imitationlearn @billyhumblebrag yeah, shin told me about it, imit convinced me to try it\n\n@alexislearning i've not tried banana nor huel black iirc! but happy you're on it, it really is the best ü™∑"
