E8xE8 supergravity? strings? tiny gnomes trading gems in a gnome economy? who knows\n\n@LizardOrman yeah all the lepton fields interact and rotate into each other so what you call the field or the particle is a preference. the flavour eigenstates aren't the mass eigenstates which is why neutrinos can change flavour\n\n@LizardOrman mostly ppl shut up and calculate and don't worry too hard about the precise field dynamics of a propagating muon\n\n@LizardOrman yeah. altho if you find anyone who can actually picture a muon properly please let me know i have a youtube video i would like to make\n\n@LizardOrman the massive muon is known to be the dynamical consequence of two massless spinor fields and the Higgs (well okay actually it's the second mass eigenstate of the lepton flavour triplet but i digress)\n\nbut who knows if those fields are made of other things\n\n@LizardOrman anyways you should probably throw out the word \"elementary\", it's not useful and can never be proven\n\n@LizardOrman it's not a string theory thing but tbh i'm still trying to find a good geometric understanding of it. spinor fields are weird. but it's *something* like a hopf fibration-looking thing? https://t.co/KI3BuH1FSt\n\n@LizardOrman i don't know what you mean by \"blip\" i guess. geometrically a fermion is something like a topologically stable \"knot\" in a fermion field, but that knot is quantum mechanically spread out in a wave. muons are two of those waves, interlinked by the Higgs\n\n@LizardOrman replied with QT because i thought it was a useful clarifier\n\nnope! \"fundamental particles\" are a complex soup of interactions: your massive muon is two Weyl spinor waves interacting through the Higgs field, setting up sympathetic ripples in the EM field, which themselves set up sympathetic ripples (loop diagrams) in other fields\n\nbut the fact that he figured it out without really understanding the microscopic mechanism for time dilation makes it so that's still how we teach it, and i think that makes a lot of people go \"ooooh spooky physics magic\"\n\ni should make a video exploring this\n\nit's kind of insane that einstein figured this stuff out *just* from the constancy of the speed of light. by rights it could have taken a full understanding of quantum field theory to puzzle out, but it didn't\n\nso the only way for you do go lightspeed is to be *entirely* phase-locked with yourself. and that means that from one point of the trajectory to another, any snapshot of you would be identical to any other snapshot of you. you are *frozen* as a single transmitted wave signal\n\nhere's the problem: the only way for you to travel at the speed of light is for all your waves to be lined up in precisely the *same* direction, going precisely the *same* speed. any internal movement while you went lightspeed would exceed the speed of light. impossible\n\nhow do you \"feel\" the passage of time? you feel it as a change in your internal state, which means something is changing relative to something else. in the \"i am waves\" picture your internal waves are clashing. they're going in different directions at different speeds and phasing\n\npeople think of this as really spooky and random, i know i did\n\nit's not, really. its downstream from the fact that you are made of waves, and all those waves have the same top speed, and that speed is light speed. let me explain\n\nin ST geometry the length of a path is best thought of as the subjective time experienced by an observer following that path\n\nso basically what this boils down to is that a lightspeed object experiences no time passing\n\nthis is unironically how spacetime geometry works. time is represented as an imaginary dimension whose square is subtracted from pythagorean distance calculations, giving lightspeed 45-degree lines \"zero length\""
