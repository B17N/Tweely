    "user": "Please analyze these tweets from @Dan Hendrycks and provide a summary of what they mainly talked about in the past week:\n\nWe do suggest clarifying an escalation ladder right in the beginning of the Maintaining MAIM section; states can clarify an intelligence recursion is intolerable and do not need to define what \"AGI\" is. Clarification can be unilateral and ladders can evolve and be supplemented with communication.\n\nThat's quite different from saying \"we need a clear agreed upon AGI definition set in stone that everyone agrees upon for deterrence to work.\"\n\nYes you can communicate and do more confidence building measures as time goes on. They will need to start to talk about this when AI becomes more salient. I do think a full-throttle intelligence recursion isn't that ambiguous. You can define risky mechanisms instead of defining superintelligence.\n\nWe do suggest clarifying an escalation ladder right in the beginning of the Maintaining MAIM section. Clarification can be unilateral and ladders can evolve and be supplemented with communication.\n\nThat's quite different from saying \"we need a clear agreed upon superintelligence definition set in stone that everyone agrees upon for deterrence to work.\"\n\nIf the risk is beyond a state’s own threshold for what is acceptable, then they will deter. It’s nice if this can be drawn in the sand and articulated beforehand, but it is not necessary.\nWe mention redlines not for deterrence but for nonproliferation in the paper.\nOther policies like if-then commitments, on the other hand, are strongly dependent on prearticulation.\n\n@METR_Evals They will be given up once they lead to a nice performance boost or inference speed up.\nI would not channel energy on requests that AI companies will predictably not keep.\n\n@datagenproc There's a bounty program for finding dataset bugs wrapping up in about a week.\n\n> Your recent personal reinvention is not convincing.\nThat image is consistent with prior statements. You said it's inaccurate and didn't give an example. I'm sorry I'm not living up to the boogeyman image you're wanting me to be.\n\n> You are a Doomer.\nI'd probably be putting chance of this going horribly wrong in the double digits, say 50/50. I'm not fatalistic about it though.\n\nMany of my positions in the image contradict how you were painting me in your post above.\n\n> global surveillance state\nExport controls do not imply a global surveillance state. We've done this for many technologies for many decades (Australia Group, Blue Lantern monitoring program, IAEA, etc.) and it hasn't necessitated a global surveillance state.\n\n* Pause AI -> did not sign Pause statement\n* Manhattan Project -> never supported that\n* Nationalization -> only have written about taxes, windfall clauses, etc.\n* InfoSec -> I've been advocating for this but not at the SCIF level; mainly been focused on critical infrastructure\n* AI autonomy -> never said to never consider them; I've been very careful not to imply that\n* Behavior restrictions -> xAI risk management framework focuses on big risks not offensive statements\n\n@Dan_Jeffries1 I'm usually recommending more medium control options https://t.co/qlFyzY4X7b\n\n@tszzl @sgodofsk I think a refined formulation of Chesteron's fence is \"the willingness to intervene should be inversely proportional to the optimization pressure behind the current state of the system\"\n\nMore slides from Rich Sutton\nhttps://t.co/N6NtxM3L1T\n\n@amasad https://t.co/gFEAf8EvwR\n\n@amasad https://t.co/ShA466MqA5\n\n@deanwball Original version would have included it but you were a fan of watering that down to cover less and less.\nAlso, SB 1047's timing for nearly high CBRN risks was almost perfect."
