This performance will create space for deep conversations about guilt, vulnerability, connection, and collective trauma through immersive rituals and discussion.\n\nüî• My dear friend and an amazing girl, art historian and cultural manager at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (@saic_news) Karyna Vovkotrub, is organizing a üá∫üá¶ performance called ‚ÄúOk, Let‚Äôs Talk About You Instead‚Äù. ‚ú®\n\nTo make this performance a reality, additional resources and ‚ù§Ô∏è our support are needed.\n\nMore details: https://t.co/180hWQCotM\n\nCypherpunks, join the @nymproject VPN Launch Livestream on Twitter or YouTube:\n\nhttps://t.co/lN8n3imMuY https://t.co/1YQ3rBpF3M\n\n@Rarimo_protocol thank you for this product!\n\n@Arvolear @Rarimo_protocol thank you for this product!\n\n@sternenko +\n\n@factcheckdotfun Why is Kyiv, Ukraine not permitted to access your platform?\n\nVitalik has built an entire digital system based on an incredible philosophy, which has given rise to thousands of blockchain products and developers.\n\nCompared to other L1s, Ethereum has been able to unlock the potential of blockchain and continues to do so. It has gathered quality like-minded people around. At this stage. And it‚Äôs simply amazing.\n\nWe need to stop thinking about the fiat equivalent of eth. It‚Äôs a big mistake.\nWe should get used to the idea that 1 ETH = 1 ETH and unite to build new products on Ethereum.\n\nYour vote may have a huge impact\n\nNate Vance, the cousin of @JDVance, said that he personally saw russians shooting their own soldiers for trying to retreat.\n\n‚ÄúThis happened so often that it could be considered their policy towards retreating soldiers. These people ‚Äòdevour‚Äô their own. They don‚Äôt care what we think. They are not our allies and won‚Äôt be for at least a generation,‚Äù said Nate Vance.\n\nThe cousin of U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, Nate Vance, fought for Ukraine as part of the Gonor (‚ÄúDa Vinci Wolves‚Äù @VovkyDaVinchi ) unit.\n\n@ethersphoenix @Ethprofit ü§úü§õ\n\n@dgtlrgnl Look at this Ukrainian fund of digitized art\nhttps://t.co/MMN6bg8DYF\n\nWhat makes you think russia is a technological state? All the smart people who could have contributed to the development of technology left this country a long time ago or were repressed.\n\nWar is terrible‚ÄîI agree with you on that. But russia and its dictatorship must be stopped, or it will spread across the world if we don‚Äôt stop it. \nThe russian empire must be dismantled FOREVER.\n\n@YourAnonCentral The author of this art is @vasylisk_tattoo\n\n@trayanmuse –°—Ç–∞–≤–ª—é –∫–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç, —â–æ–± –ø—Ä–æ—Å—É–Ω—É—Ç–∏ —Ç–≤—ñ—Ç"
