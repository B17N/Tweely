    "user": "Please analyze these tweets from @Matthew Yglesias and provide a summary of what they mainly talked about in the past week:\n\n@lionel_trolling I think who wins senate elections in small states is pretty important.\n\nA principled defense of free speech is valuable and important.\n\nThe administration is trying to use the specifics of this one guy to establish a sweeping and alarming legal standard.\n\n@KarthikForTexas I think it‚Äôs probably Colorado and Virginia, which is in part because they are benefiting from some of the legacy of having been red states in the past so less cruft built up but they expanded Medicaid and have legal abortion.\n\nThe 2024 senate candidate who ran strongest relative to the top of the ticket was Larry Hogan not Dan Osborn ‚Äî there are good lessons to learn from Osborn‚Äôs run but the idea that disaffiliating from the Democratic Party is magic isn‚Äôt one of them.\n\n@jbarro Also Dodd-Frank and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan!\n\nIn states like New York and Maryland where the electorate is to the left of the national average, Democrats win office easily ‚Äî good for them! \n\nBut are they doing a good job of achieving progressive ends? Of making their states thrive? Harder and more interesting questions.\n\nTo me the challenging, interesting part of politics is the part where you need to try to govern the country. \n\nLots of hard questions and tradeoffs here and I for sure don‚Äôt have all the answers.\n\nBut we‚Äôre stuck in a doom loop of debating the most obvious question instead.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to deny that these things matter but do we think Susan Collins consistently wins crossover voters in a blue state because of her ineffable charisma &amp; communications skills, or is it mostly just that she‚Äôs seen as moderate?\n\n@sunraysunray IMO the most interesting question is why is the Canadian right so weak. \n\nOn its face NDP/Liberal vote splitting seems disastrous (and there are Greens too!) but somehow the Conservatives usually lose.\n\n@AlanMCole Yeah it‚Äôs more like the second coming of Duck Gephardt or David Bonior than the Democrats who won.\n\nMaking a deal for New York to keep congestion pricing but also build a pipeline to bring Pennsylvania natural gas to New England would be a great step in the right direction ‚Äî more growth and less air pollution throughout the northeast.\n\nhttps://t.co/FImDUC0brf\n\nA return to a pragmatic energy policy that is informed by science but takes the international coordination issues and cost-benefit analysis more seriously is the biggest adjustment that could help progressives across the rich world.\n\nhttps://t.co/Up2UC3FOb0\n\nInstead of reacting to the widely understood political failure of carbon pricing by saying ‚ÄúI guess we can‚Äôt ask people to make material sacrifices for the sake of emissions reduction,‚Äù Democrats have often tried to find ideas with hidden costs.\n\n@AlanMCole https://t.co/UF4uJPGPm9\n\nThis tends to get overlooked in intra-party debates because both left-wing and moderate intellectuals and writer types tend to be very committed to the climate agenda ‚Äî but the voters aren‚Äôt! \n\nhttps://t.co/WzaNJOe8jl\n\nThere‚Äôs constantly paranoia among leftist intellectuals that the influx of professional class voters into the Democratic Party will undermine commitment to progressive taxation and the social safety net, but the actual place where you see the class betrayal is the degrowth turn.\n\nI think a big reason why left-populism works politically in Mexico is that notwithstanding Sheinbaum‚Äôs background in environmentalism, Morena takes a more pragmatic and growth-oriented approach to energy policy than American progressives.\n\nhttps://t.co/txyOe1epHr https://t.co/BKZejaJER4\n\n@yeselson @sunraysunray But this is my point ‚Äî if you rephrase the question as ‚Äúwhy are Democrats about average at winning?‚Äù the whole leftist complaint evaporates. There‚Äôs nothing interesting going on!\n\n@sunraysunray Average is different from bad! Also I think you‚Äôre counting wrong on a couple of these.\n\nSome kind of non-insane group inside the Trump administration decided that we should import more eggs to address the shortage, and prices are now falling rapidly. \n\nWorth considering the implications for tariff policy! https://t.co/KrmFSyHSHr\n\n@waitbutwhy Looks pretty cool tho\n\n@Rory_Johnston So there‚Äôs hope left for carbon price true believers ?\n\n‚ùå Ecopessimism\n‚ùå Racial paranoia\n‚ùå National decline\n\n‚úÖ Growth\n‚úÖ Openness \n‚úÖ Perpetual domination https://t.co/PJu1hTyxKm\n\nInterested in a version of the abundance agenda linked to a national security vision with a clear view of America‚Äôs role in the world? \n\nI‚Äôd like to introduce you to One Billion Americans.\n\nImportant üëáüëáüëá\n\nNext week Slow Boring is going to mix things up with a take on the very close elections or 1888 and 1892 and how the failure of the McKinley Tariff of 1890 paradoxically set the stage for McKinley to win a presidential election six years later.\n\n@lhfang @razibkhan She was a waitress at Coffee Shop at one point but then later was a bartender at Flats Fix https://t.co/lfwsTJZBGy\n\n‚ÄúPlease like me, Elon!‚Äù\n\nThe party of the people dunking on AOC for having worked in food service ‚Äî this is a very common job for people to do!\n\nhttps://t.co/1LXG78t2dy\n\nIt‚Äôs so over for carbon tax bros (ie me)\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean Trump is a cuddly harmless figure (he‚Äôs a corrupt, vicious liar and dangerous threat to the rule of law) but he‚Äôs not a counterexample to the idea that moderate stands on key issues can help you win.\n\nI think a big distortion in people‚Äôs thinking is that while there is obviously a sense in which Donald Trump is very extreme, it‚Äôs also true that he goes to great lengths to do things like disavow Paul Ryan‚Äôs Medicare plan or the idea of a national abortion ban.\n\nI was interested to learn reading ‚ÄúEmma‚Äù that husbands and wives have been having this exact argument about cleaning for over two hundred years even in a context where servants were doing the work anyway. https://t.co/cg9S8U4vhh\n\nWhat‚Äôs cool is we can do shutdown fight all over again in September, hopefully with a clearer negotiating position next time!\n\nMaybe I‚Äôm wrong and these people are all idiots. \n\nI‚Äôd encourage anyone who‚Äôs convinced that‚Äôs the case to run for office! If there are dramatically better ideas it would be genuinely great to see it in action.\n\nJust like structurally why would it be easy to win elections while leading any kind of progressive political party ‚Äî you are almost by definition challenging the prerogatives of business interests and the prejudices of the sociocultural majority and that‚Äôs difficult!\n\nI think this is an important question ‚Äî it‚Äôs widely believed that the Democrats are ‚Äúbad at what they do‚Äù but globally speaking, which left of center party has a stronger track-record of winning elections in the 21st century? https://t.co/FV01zuiOqE\n\nBy taxing Canadian lumber?\n\nMy big picture view: \n\n1. Trust the process on Trump, see the chart \n\n2. ‚ÄúFight‚Äù in elections ‚Äî the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, the NY-21 special\n\n3. Ditch some of Dems‚Äô least popular stances, big tent recruitment for 2026 https://t.co/lGlLHla18F\n\nI think people are most cross-pressured on economics! \n\nTypical voter wants to see his taxes reduced, favors making Social Security &amp; Medicare more generous, and wants to balance the budget.\n\nThe real divide among democrats isn‚Äôt left versus right, it‚Äôs about masking ideological disputes in largely bad faith generational considerations that nobody adheres to with any consistency.\n\nOh\n\nReasonable people can disagree about exactly what the cross-pressured, crossover voters want. \n\nBut they mostly describe themselves as \"moderate\" and the politicians who are good at winning their votes tend to cluster in self-consciously moderate caucuses.\n\nI really have to say that if one of the cornerstones of your political analysis is that moderate voters literally do not exist, then you have a big problem. \n\nWhat's up with Susan Collins? \n\nHow did Roy Cooper win? \n\nHow come Don Bacon is holding down a key seat?\n\nNotable that Republican sentiment went down too, it's not pure partisan expression.\n\nIMO it is correct and wise of @jelani9 to give people an accurate assessment of the legal situation rather than engage in cheap talk boosterism.\n\nImagine what the Trump administration would be doing with these tools if this had been enacted https://t.co/QUjJfyxJCM\n\nIf you want to fight harder, take concrete action to win races ‚Äî this one is coming up in a few weeks and Elon Musk thinks it‚Äôs important enough to spend millions of dollars on.\n\nEverything is tariff https://t.co/5F4HoXf9cS\n\nIncredible timeline we are living in\n\nA continuing resolution is a continuing resolution. \n\nAppropriations mandated by law continue to be mandated. \n\nThere‚Äôs no law to make impoundment double plus illegal that Congress can pass, SCOTUS will rule on the constitutional issue either way.\n\nThis is why I‚Äôm getting into Reading Old Novels \n\nhttps://t.co/J6XoGhBwqf\n\nGuy who‚Äôs launching a new short-selling hedge fund because he thinks Trump is wrecking the American economy https://t.co/eNCQiTaLlF\n\n@Wombat652 Well you have to follow the links\n\nBiden's numbers fell from there, but he didn't sink to Trump's current level of popularity until the 236th day of his presidency after the Delta Variant and the Fall of Kabul. \n\n(but he also got a major social safety net expansion done in the meantime) https://t.co/mJ1U2jBTv9\n\nTime can play tricks on you.\n\nAt this point in Joe Biden's presidency he was 15-16 percentage points more popular than Trump is today and had already passed a $1.9 trillion partisan bill while enacting a \"flurry\" of new executive orders. https://t.co/vCShvquT7W\n\nI would be willing to wager a considerable sum of money that we will not see a balanced budget at any point during Trump's term in office. \n\nAny takers?\n\nJews do very well in the United States, but the rise in anti-semitism is very real, not limited to issues related to Israel, and is present among young people across the board ‚Äî¬†not actually concentrated on the left or elite college campuses.\n\nhttps://t.co/RGyJw45UV2 https://t.co/AaFOp3iLT6\n\nThe orange man is also bad in some slightly random and surprising low-profile ways\n\nA few days late, but some remembrances of Kevin Drum who was really one of the best of us on the early blogosphere and also the only non-deranged anti-YIMBY writer. \n\nhttps://t.co/RGyJw45UV2\n\n@Turbosloth3 @katewillett Just for the record, I wasn't at the 2008 Democratic Convention. The outlet I was working for at the time sent me to the GOP convention in St Paul that year instead.\n\nIf it's the latter, I think we have a very serious disagreement about the facts. \n\nIf it's the former I am on your side. I am also upset and also want to express that. \n\nHelp Susan Crawford beat her Musk-backed opponent on April 1, that'll feel good.\n\nhttps://t.co/6xMAxfnJoD\n\nMy challenge to everyone who is frustrated tonight is to try to ask yourself: Are you mad because you're upset about the situation in America and you want to express that anger? \n\nOr are you made because you think if Dems filibustered Trump would agree to end DOGE?\n\nIt is true that lots of Dems, especially the ones who post a lot on the internet and a large fraction of the donors, have a primarily expressive engagement in politics and their thinking about these kinds of topics is dominated by expressive considerations .. and that's bad!\n\nPeople keep telling me that I don't get it, they just want to see the Democrats fight harder. \n\nBut I totally do get that! \n\nThe desire is for Democrats to take expressive action, most of the caucus agrees with that, and Schumer is being responsible.\n\nhttps://t.co/8aU6j6QOOi\n\nThe orange man is bad \n\nhttps://t.co/Om1r8BnmW2\n\nSchumer is right\n\nhttps://t.co/8aU6j6QOOi\n\n@sandeepvaheesan You know the New Deal predated NEPA, the APA, public sector labor unions, etc right?\n\n@besttrousers It's time to build (masked vigilantes)\n\n@patdennis I want to hear it\n\nThe way you \"stop Republicans\" is to beat them in elections by having party leaders adopt more moderate stances on key issues and take a big tent approach to candidate recruitment. That Republicans do bad things when they win is the reason why progressives should embrace this. https://t.co/FDUIgboGOq\n\nThere is no language you could add to any bill that would avoid the looming Supreme Court showdown about the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act ‚Äî if SCOTUS says that's good law, then it's good law. \n\nIf they say it's unconstitutional, no rider changes that.\n\nA shutdown is itself DOGE on steroids. \n\nElon would declare whichever minority federal workers he doesn't want to fire \"essential\" furlough everyone else and declare victory. You'd end up with Democrats begging the GOP to pass a CR and bring the workers back.\n\nThis is correct, all my friends in DC are hopping mad about the way we are getting screwed on this bill (I am also mad) so it's especially a hothouse environment for Hill staffers and members.\n\nIt's time for everyone to admit they were too mean to poor Jared Kushner who was actually a moderating influence on Trump and also deeply involved in his first term's most successful initiatives. Now it's all just psychos.\n\n\"I don‚Äôt know why the Connecticut bridge replacements are so expensive, beyond the observation that everything in Connecticut is exceptionally expensive, usually even by the standards of other Northeastern American rail projects\"\n\nhttps://t.co/O5G3iMmkgL\n\n@senatorshoshana @bendreyfuss ‚ÄúGo out with me, I was mugged in Russia in 1998 before it was cool.‚Äù\n\n@senatorshoshana @bendreyfuss I got mugged in Russia but you don‚Äôt see me posting about it\n\nAnyways https://t.co/BXrs99Y4xG\n\n@matthewstoller I think the appropriate use of antitrust authority is absolutely part of an abundance agenda, that‚Äôs the whole point of the consumer welfare standard.\n\nVoting ‚Äúno‚Äù in the House and hoping the GOP couldn‚Äôt get their shit together to pass anything was a plausible gambit to try ‚Äî I called for it, and ex ante it was a good idea ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt work.\n\nThere‚Äôs no play in the senate.\n\nDems who vote to allow cloture will take shit from a lot of posters, donors, and even some fellow members but in fact are taking one for the team and advancing the larger cause of winning in 2026 which is the only meaningful way to gain a check on Trump.\n\n@lymanstoneky Do you have a post on this? Or a link to someone else?\n\nHamilton Project real time expenditure tracker is fascinating https://t.co/RcoJmGV5Co\n\nThread on technical solutions to falling fertility\n\nI think Ezra‚Äôs record supporting reparations in the Redford Administration may make him unelectable.\n\n@awprokop I‚Äôve heard Republicans were surprised Democrats voted for it and took that to be a bad sign that the bill was too soft.\n\nRINO\n\n@MarcDamon9 It‚Äôs about as good as you can do but there is just no reason you would ever wear the bat ears or have the logo\n\nI‚Äôm still a ‚Äúthe senate should pass laws by majority vote‚Äù guy which would resolve all these shutdown tactical dilemmas. \n\nPeople shouldn‚Äôt need to vote for bills they think are bad to avert the government from shutting down!\n\n‚ÄúBatman Begins‚Äù is a fascinating document because they are trying really hard to make a psychologically &amp; logistically realistic origin story and it‚Äôs pretty well-done except at a certain point he has to decide to dress up like a bat because that‚Äôs what Batman is about.\n\n@besttrousers @tahrajirari The popularity of \"Hamilton\" is probably responsible for this.\n\nJust to confirm: The University of Kentucky where Gaines went to school teaches a very normal set of economics courses that cover tariffs and trade. https://t.co/KBEEGHhqyF\n\nThey definitely taught economics classes at the schools I attended. https://t.co/Yau3kPzPJt\n\nShe's right!!\n\nStill seems like bad news for people at or near retirement or for entrepreneurs looking to raise capital.\n\nIf I were president, I would simply make the net present value of discounted future earnings go up rather than down.\n\n@BrianCDeese @ForeignAffairs I really liked this article, but would be interested in hearing more based on your experience in the government about why this is so hard to fix.\n\nThe first New York Times article I could find about the launch of Project 2025 was from April 2023. \n\nI don't find it all that surprising that there isn't a parallel public effort among Democrats ~2 months after Trump's inauguration. https://t.co/NxAqtEqGvV\n\n@AsteadWH When did Project 2025 launch?\n\nShouldn't Democrats trust the process here instead of insisting congress needs to pass new laws?\n\nhttps://t.co/jzZLT4EMVO\n\nSecretary Mayor Pete should get a custom URL!\n\nhttps://t.co/cHvNTnMoF6\n\nMore and more people are saying that the orange man is bad!\n\n@emre_mayo It's worse, he's comparing us to *India*\n\nPersonally, I think \"Biden-era Democrats made some serious mistakes and then blew the opportunity presented by the candidate swap\" is the political star of our time. \n\nBut even \"Biden was perfect and just had random bad luck\" makes more sense than \"Trump is a genius.\"\n\nI keep hearing various forms of envy from Democrats of Trump's communications skills or other allegedly positive attributes but he's less popular than any president other than himself so I don't know exactly what the lesson to learn is. https://t.co/ifOaDvSLTk\n\nThis is why I try to avoid getting sucked into watching well-regarded television shows until after they're finished. \n\nThe nice thing about movies is critics watch the end before they write their reviews!\n\nThe fact that tariffs reduce investment in the United States, leading to a smaller capital stock, lower productivity, and lower wages and living standards seems like a very good reason to hate them!\n\nhttps://t.co/dC5Rhc89YP\n\n@CartoonsHateHer of course\n\nSomeone needs to play Trump the part of the song where they mention that Polk \"made sure the tariffs fell\" and \"built an Independent Treasury\"! https://t.co/iILYotXpEj\n\n@CartoonsHateHer I have seen a DOGE-adjacent perception that the federal civilian workforce is all ladies doing email jobs who need to be disemployed so they settle, but this seems to be at odds with the demographic facts. \n\nhttps://t.co/VPp7DpwvVH https://t.co/xwCpbBNgoY\n\nWe love Denny!\n\nThe most paranoid interpretation of Trump's trade policy that I've ever heard came to me from a libertarian woman who speculated that the goal is specifically to reduce women's earnings relative to men even though it makes everyone poorer on average to \"fix\" precisely this.\n\nBook excerpts here. \n\nhttps://t.co/h4TAQxPrs6\n\nWhat's done is done, but just another reason that smart candidates in 2026 and 2028 will do what Harris didn't and throw Biden under the bus. \n\nhttps://t.co/sZ8ljF2rDx\n\nReporting from @jonallendc &amp; @amieparnes about how Biden and his team tried to box Harris in so she'd avoid articulating any breaks with him on policy. https://t.co/ANif70WuGU\n\n@StefanFSchubert Never totally sure how to think about these comparisons since (as if often the case in Europe) a place like Malm√∂ is dramatically more ‚Äúurban‚Äù than any comparable sized US city (Little Rock or Provo) and I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see the same trends.\n\nTired: I was only following orders \n\nWired: I was only issuing orders\n\nJed didn‚Äôt do policy recommendations, but I think municipal leaders need to wake up to the new reality that builders are still *willing* to invest in urban infill housing but the desperation to do it isn‚Äôt there anymore. Need to think about the entire regulatory stack.\n\nTwo key charts ‚Äî the childless affluent youngish people who drove pre-Covid urban demand have been leaning, and while housing prices have risen everywhere they‚Äôve risen least in cities.\n\nUrban demand is really falling.\n\nhttps://t.co/LENfA50Xr9 https://t.co/QwN5wuU6uo\n\nWe‚Äôve got @JedKolko on the ‚ÄôStack today with some bad news about the largely illusory recovery in urban demand (driven by the now-over immigration surge) and the return of pandemic-era suburbanization trends. https://t.co/CHIzKwy1fH\n\nIncredible Elon Musk take https://t.co/V6S8t4cxwq\n\n@digiphile It does matter, that‚Äôs true.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to counsel complacency in the face of this wrecking crew, but it‚Äôs a mistake to give in to Trump‚Äôs self-mythologizing as an unstoppable man of action or as someone who none dare criticize lest he smite them. https://t.co/mDekN38X8d\n\nIt really is worth saying that to the best of my knowledge we continue to live in a society with the rule of law and when Trump pushed the envelop in eleven different dimensions he loses in court a lot. https://t.co/45ARhDdU5r\n\n@AliceFromQueens https://t.co/3RtACSLQWT\n\nPedocon theory is the only truth\n\n@digiphile Well, I believe that my Twitter audience's input to DCOP may influence their decision-making whereas I don't think John Thune really cares.\n\nCool. \n\nhttps://t.co/FaFQRMiVga\n\nIsn't the US-Ireland trade deficit mostly just companies cheating on their taxes in ways that Trump keeps making it harder to police? https://t.co/FFt6gLK6xB\n\nIf you live in (or even just commute into) this city please take a few minutes to engage in the misguided public input process and tell them you want abundant housing and a growing economy.\n\nThis is insane and obviously at odds with the fake claim that they are urgently trying to reduce debt!\n\nThe actual thing that happened here was people said ‚Äúweird the other indicators aren‚Äôt consistent with a recession‚Äù and then when full data was in, it turned out that there actually *weren‚Äôt* two quarters of GDP contraction and the recession skeptics were correct. https://t.co/HOYcgt9ZM8\n\n@AaronBergman18 I think the European Union is basically a giant liberal project\n\n@fshakir What should it be?\n\nThe stock market plus the bond market is the economy, but you need both.\n\nWhat's different is that in 1993 he understood that the basic structure of the situation made it likely that Russia would wage a war of aggression against Ukraine absent nuclear weapons or external support whereas more recently he's implied Russia was provoked.\n\nTo be clear, the through-line here is that Mearsheimer does not want the United States to commit itself to defending Ukraine so 30 years ago he thought Ukraine should go nuclear as an alternative strategy. \n\nhttps://t.co/2HVvWZnqlw\n\n@wesyang It's not inconsistent, it's just interesting!\n\nFascinating byline. \n\nhttps://t.co/RHhu4WBGRo https://t.co/THPgM2aZMC\n\nAs a person who believes in accurate records, I still think they should actually fix this even if it doesn‚Äôt save any money! \n\nhttps://t.co/CN9TGbeNdN\n\nThe other thing from this story is DOGE has apparently quietly conceded that Trump and Musk were full of shit about dead people collecting Social Security benefits https://t.co/yCly0QIP2I\n\nOh\n\nThis is a really good @BrianCDeese piece on the need to unleash change in the built environment across multiple dimensions. \n\nhttps://t.co/V01IxMC7ao\n\nIt just turns out that the practical and moral difference between even \"do literally nothing to advance progressive causes on any issue\" and \"implement the Republican Party platform\" is actually very large and the routine stakes of elections are very high!\n\nThe leftist cycle is that before Election Day you whine and moan and complain about \"the lesser of two evils\" and how uninspiring it is and then the day after Republicans win you whine and moan about how Democrats aren't blocking everything the new GOP is doing.\n\nIf you want to do something right now that feels like fighting, I would give money to Susan Crawford in Wisconsin and try to beat Elon Musk and help her win. \n\nhttps://t.co/NRKrmYWh32 https://t.co/9gvcY3AUF3\n\nI liked this trailer for Andor where he says \"you're in a war ‚Äî do you wanna fight or you wanna win?\" \n\nI understand that people have mixed feelings about this and I sincerely understand the impulse to want to fight. \n\nBut winning is better. \n\nhttps://t.co/BqSrmRtcud\n\nWhat Democrats need to execute an effective appropriations strategy is to control one house of congress so that they can control the agenda. \n\nI know that's not what people want to hear. They want to fight back. This sucks. Losing sucks!\n\nThe problem with blocking the House-passed CR at this point is that everyone knows there's no real path to victory, it's an expressive exercise in trying to pass the hot potato of folding to someone else so that person can attract the ire of angry democrats.\n\nIf there was no filibuster (which there shouldn't be) this would be an easy choice for Senate Democrats ‚Äî copy your House colleagues and vote \"no\" on a bad bill. \n\nBut the filibuster exists and it's become routine to filibuster everything that is filibuster-able.\n\nToday on the pod @brianbeutler and I talk about possible anti-Tesla policy actions and I express some grave doubts about the wisdom of pushing Democrats to filibuster a CR. \n\nhttps://t.co/YV4wwmy8NO\n\nThis is a good cycle for older incumbents from blue states to step aside in a climate where it will be relatively easy for their successors to win.\n\nWe have some good legislative progress on housing supply, but also some bad examples of jurisdictions moving in the wrong direction. \n\nhttps://t.co/eWRkf0wIzN\n\nMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.\n\n@jeffhauser @InlandCaGuy Joe Biden? The menswear guy?\n\nLook, Jeff, you are very good at what you do. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre the LeBron James of exiling heretics and shrinking the Democratic Party tent.
