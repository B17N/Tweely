In prison, everything is on buttons with timers.\n\nAfter nearly two months in freedom, I still find myself staring at faucets and shower heads, waiting for them to turn off! So weird."

  "summary": "In the past week, @Ross Ulbricht tweeted about his experiences in prison where he didn't have traditional water fixtures and everything operated with buttons and timers. Even after being out of prison for nearly two months, he still finds himself adjusting to having regular faucets and shower heads, highlighting the challenges of readjusting to life outside of incarceration. The sentiment in the tweets appears to convey a mix of reminiscence about prison life and the strangeness of transitioning back to normalcy.",
