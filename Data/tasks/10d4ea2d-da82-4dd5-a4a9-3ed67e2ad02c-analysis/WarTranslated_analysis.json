    "user": "Please analyze these tweets from @WarTranslated and provide a summary of what they mainly talked about in the past week:\n\nA Russian soldier filmed a road-graveyard of equipment in Kursk, shocked by the sight, when suddenly a Ukrainian drone turned his car into a new exhibit of this \"museum.\" https://t.co/Z5Fx4bMf3M\n\nRussians posted footage of a \"Shahed\" drone launch from a car. It took off to boost Ukrainian air defense stats. https://t.co/oclWNNi28C\n\n\"Europe is on the brink of civilizational suicide,\" US Vice President Vance told Fox News. \"Countries don’t control borders, restrict free speech. If Germany takes in millions more incompatible migrants, it’ll destroy itself. America can’t save it.\" https://t.co/4p4dTZ8AVX\n\nAnother clear example of how Russian propaganda channels shoot their videos about \"Sudzha martyrs\". In the footage one and the same Sudzha resident first talks to Ukrainian soldiers when they still fully controlled the city and in the second video he is already in a Russian propaganda studio crying about occupation horrors. Humanitarian aid in Sudzha today is only available after a well-acted scene on camera.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia hosts a grand parade of propaganda genius. State channels, in a frenzy of florid absurdity, compete to weave the most exquisite tale of Sudzha’s ‘martyrs.’ Their style: bombast, lies, even a nod to Poles. Humanitarian aid, it seems, demands a fresh fable of ‘torture’ on camera.\n\nUkrainian developers from the \"SkyDefenders\" team presented footage of the trials of a shotgun-equipped aircraft-type UAV interceptor. https://t.co/Mg9bl1UvoN\n\nIt seems a commander of a Russian army tactical group has rebelled. In a video, he complains that soldiers are sent to hopeless positions like cattle, valued only for equipment, not their lives. He notes the command doesn’t care about operations and suggests sending them to the front line instead of the troops.\n\nWar correspondent Steshin, a propagandist for \"Komsomolka,\" proposes a brilliant plan: take Ukraine's Russian-speaking regions and the sea, and for those who won’t switch to Russian — suitcase, train station, Siberia. https://t.co/jnBjabwu4J\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War confirmed that there is no geolocation evidence of encirclement of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region. At the same time, Zelensky reported that the operation of our forces in designated areas of the Kursk region continues. Meanwhile, military buildup is observed on the eastern border.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Russian town of Tuapse, the oil refinery has been burning spectacularly for the second consecutive day. Judging by the footage, compared to yesterday, the fire has expanded its reach and is now engulfing other tanks. https://t.co/hXo9Sc3L6X\n\nHungarian PM Orbán issued 12 demands to the EU, including: a Europe of nations, equal rights for countries, strong veto power, sovereignty, border protection, no migrants or Ukraine in the Union. Otherwise what? Blocking EU decisions? Notably, EU leaders are reportedly discussing stripping Hungary of its veto power over some decisions.\n\nFPV drones of the Ukrainian Armed Forces took out a squad of e-scooter-riding clowns floundering across a field near Pokrovsk. It’s more like a prank from Russian command on their own troops. https://t.co/bjcwlqNBTz\n\nWorld: So, when will those 24 hours come in which you end the war?\nTrump: Oh, that was just a joke. https://t.co/uNOFJkdq6C\n\nA volunteer known by the call sign \"Dutchman\" has shared powerful new footage from the frontline city of Pokrovsk—battered but unbroken, a steadfast symbol of Ukrainian resilience. https://t.co/Rzi4CkKWuv\n\nTrump opened his mouth at the interview, and the fuzzy microphone said, 'Be quiet, small man, I’m in charge.' https://t.co/D3HvAir4VM\n\nTraditionally, \"Akhmat\" heroically shows up in captured towns only after other RF units clear them, when it’s safe to stream on TikTok. They \"liberated\" Sudzha heroically on camera. https://t.co/2UjF2eRIjN\n\nAnother case where children, instead of a carefree childhood, play with weapons and trophies, preparing for war. A boy ~12 years old in a bulletproof vest with chevrons and an AK-74 near unit flags dreams of becoming a soldier. Kursk region. https://t.co/Vk2pa5Dv7r\n\nPutin speaks of humanity toward Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region, whom he imagines he has surrounded in his delusions. He cites fabricated war crimes, yet he shells civilian cities, executes prisoners, and labels terror as justice. His call to surrender is not mercy but the lie of a tyrant steeped in blood, while Trump only echoes his tune.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister for European Integration Stefanishyna announced that Ukraine's EU membership in 2030 is effectively confirmed. The credibility and seriousness of this intention are demonstrated by the fact that the EU budget for 2026–2032/33 is being prepared with Ukraine's potential membership in mind.\n\nMark Rubio stated that Washington remains cautiously optimistic about ongoing talks with Moscow regarding the Ukrainian settlement. The U.S. will assess Russia's position this weekend, with Special Envoy Whitcoff set to report on the outcome of discussions in Moscow. https://t.co/a43K6jXalG\n\nThe mineral agreement is finalized and negotiations have concluded. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Stefanishyna said that they are now awaiting approval from the United States. The text has been agreed upon without any changes. Ukraine is ready to sign at any time, while the U.S. is still determining the terms and timing.\n\nToday, passengers aboard the train to Tuapse in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, marveled at a breathtaking, awe-inspiring landscape unfolding beyond their windows, thanks to Ukrainian UAVs. Video show flames raging from reservoirs at the Tuapse Oil Refinery. https://t.co/sEE31UcJG0\n\nThe General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that rumors of the \"encirclement\" of Ukrainian units in the Kursk region are Russian lies meant to intimidate—something even Trump seems to have fallen for, by the way. https://t.co/SWZU1l5UHK\n\nRussian fighter, apparently participating in the battles near Sudzha in Russia’s Kursk Oblast, disclosed that their command has inexplicably barred them from targeting Ukrainian forces during their withdrawal. https://t.co/btmRI7vZK1\n\nI feel kinda sorry for the old man. Just like putin he’s delirious and delusional and lives on another planet thanks to the helpful aides. https://t.co/P9UrgHyISF\n\nRussian soldiers got the privilege of observing NATO equipment up close. Their primitive worldview shattered into pieces, and their feeble minds short-circuited from the realization that homo sapiens can master more than one language. https://t.co/hKAInXA6ss\n\nTrump announced on his social network, Truth Social, that he had a \"very good\" phone conversation with Putin yesterday, where he \"strongly urged\" him to save the supposedly \"encircled\" Ukrainian soldiers. He also mentioned that there is a \"very good chance\" to end the war. It is evident that the negotiations were conducted under the Kremlin's terms.\n\nThe Financial Times writes that due to Budapest's blackmail regarding EU sanctions against Russia, discussions among member countries about possibly depriving Hungary of its voting rights have intensified. If Orban repeats this in July, the EU's determination may reach its peak.\nhttps://t.co/RwgoJv455h\n\nNATO Secretary General Rutte told Bloomberg: \"Post-war, it’d be reasonable to gradually rebuild ties with Russia, but we’re not there yet. We must keep pressuring them to take talks seriously. Ukraine’s entry into NATO is no longer being considered.\" When asked, \"Is Trump really taking Ukraine’s NATO membership off the negotiating table?\" Rutte replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nA Russian soldier recorded a Ukrainian drone giving him a \"warm welcome\" – chasing him and hitting just by his feet. Miraculously alive, likely to savor his \"special operation\" trip a bit more. Probably not for long, though – ZSU drones rarely extend such \"tourist passes\" for too long.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian drones continue to strike Russian military targets deep in enemy territory. Mulino, Nizhny Novgorod region: the moment of a UAV attack on a military training ground was recorded just moments ago. https://t.co/XTHiRHTsSC\n\nLukashenko's speech seemed to amuse Russian parliamentarians, who could barely contain their laughter. He stated that Russia is unlikely to join Belarus anytime soon, and likewise, Belarus will not join Russia in the near future. https://t.co/YfmHgf1Vj1\n\nLukashenko, whose \"honest word is as strong as stone,\" spoke in the Russian parliament. He stated that Belarus would not allow a stab in the back to its \"blood brother\" Russia, but emphasized a multipolar foreign policy, as if distancing himself from blind loyalty to Putin. As if anyone still believes in this nobility: for 30 years he has \"not clung\" to power, swore to Ukrainian journalists that no Russian soldier would come to Ukraine from Belarus. Reality has shown the value of his promises.\n\nHungary's leading stand-up comedian, Orban, has made a claim that Brussels is allegedly promising Ukraine EU membership in exchange for continuing the war with Russia. It's hard to tell whether he genuinely believes this, or if he's just performing another act to please the Kremlin.\n\nUkrainian SBU drones struck two gas compressor stations and an S-300/S-400 missile depot, creating a fireworks display. Videos from Russian forums capture hits on equipment and powerful explosions. https://t.co/eomEzWRfBe\n\nIn Finland, Russian neo-Nazi Yan Petrovsky from \"Rusich\" got life for war crimes in Ukraine in 2014-15. The \"Rusich\" DShRG fighter killed 22 Ukrainian soldiers and maimed four. https://t.co/wg3S9K9ijj\n\nThe U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, got axed from peace talks after the Kremlin choked on his “too pro-Ukrainian” vibe, per NBC News. Looks like Moscow’s spooked he’ll dodge their games and stand rock-solid against Russian manipulation.\n\nhttps://t.co/Qo6Lmz4OEi\n\nIn Tuapse, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, Ukrainian drones gave locals an explosive wake-up call, striking the oil refinery. Time to fire up the BBQ! https://t.co/CMQXxYCBOY\n\nRussian aviation struck Kherson region with 10 guided bombs. https://t.co/DLx92Q4kxt\n\nCouldn't walk for long in Sudzha. https://t.co/y7nFymN5K8\n\n🇸🇪 Sweden will purchase 18 Archer artillery systems and Arthur radars for Ukraine.\n\nThe total cost of this aid is approximately 3 billion Swedish kronor (almost 300 million dollars) and is part of the 18th military support package for Ukraine.\nhttps://t.co/K3fOfiC2xC https://t.co/jAj7JbOWRM\n\nThe US president said he would like to see a ceasefire from Russia and hopes that \"Russia will do the right thing,\" because if not, it will be a very \"disappointing moment for the whole world.\" https://t.co/rTimqclMMm\n\nPutin stated that he is in favor of a ceasefire, but on Russia's terms. https://t.co/V4JLaLaLVf\n\nThe hit of a Russian FAB-3000 aerial bomb with a UMPK module captured by a Ukrainian drone in the Kursk region. https://t.co/4wOqJPBg6C\n\nAssault: an approach to enemy positions through the eyes of the warriors of the \"Spartan\" brigade. https://t.co/exWPtw6VR8\n\nAssistant to the President of the Russian Federation Ushakov reported that the meeting between Vitkoff and Putin will take place this evening in a closed format.\nHe also added that there are no plans for a meeting between Putin and Trump.\n\nLukashenko: It's not the first election in Belarus.\nYes, and not even your second election. https://t.co/JxI1v85fPO\n\nPutin said that the relationship between Russia and Belarus could be an example for other countries. \n\nYeah. Indeed. https://t.co/Jwcux6tvki\n\nLukashenko stated that Belarus is manufacturing launchers for the \"Oreshnik\".\n\nThe self-proclaimed Belarusian president shared this information with Russian propagandists during his visit to Moscow, where he is meeting with Putin today. https://t.co/sJMyFR3ShW\n\nPrime Minister of Ukraine Shmyhal stated that the first tranche of $1.7 billion of frozen Russian assets has been received by Ukraine from Canada.\n\nZelensky on the 30-day truce proposed by the United States: \"Unfortunately, the world has not heard a substantive response from Russia for more than a day regarding the proposals that were made.\"\n\n\"And this again confirms that it is Russia that seeks to continue the war and will try to delay the onset of peace as much as possible. We hope that the pressure from the United States will be enough to force Russia to end the war.\" - said the president, who listened to reports from the Ukrainian delegation about the meeting with representatives of the United States in Saudi Arabia.\n\nRussians on the streets of Sudzha and near \"Pyaterochka\" are showing how they \"defended\" the city by bombing it over the past seven months. https://t.co/kszW3voiBw\n\n\"The proposal for a temporary truce is nothing more than a short break for Ukrainian troops; steps that imitate peace efforts are unnecessary for anyone.\" - said the dictator's aide, Yuri Ushakov.\n\nHe did not rule out Putin commenting on the proposal for a temporary truce today. https://t.co/jjZnQAjuOw\n\nAccording to various sources, drones of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine have struck a concealed drone manufacturing facility in the Kaluga region.\n\nLong-range strike drones of the Main Directorate of Intelligence targeted the UAV production site in the village of Obukhovo, Dzerzhinsky district, Kaluga region, last evening. The assembly lines for drones were located in the workshops of the \"Kaluga Aerated Concrete\" plant. Local residents were the first to report powerful explosions and a fire at the facility.\n\nWitkoff is now in Moscow, and about to hear how Moscow wants full capitulation of Ukraine and withdrawal from all four partially occupied regions, along with other nonsense.\n\nPolls show that after the argument in the Oval Office, 7 out of 10 Ukrainians support Zelensky. Are Trump and Musk still sure they want elections?\n\nPutin put on camouflage and came to the Kursk region for the first time since the beginning of the Ukrainian operation in Kursk. https://t.co/uzeKa8zKuA\n\n🇸🇪 The Swedish company SAAB and the Ukrainian company Radionix have signed a memorandum on strategic partnership, according to the company's press service.\n\nThe memorandum outlines cooperation in the field of military electronics and sensors.\nhttps://t.co/52Heqn4H4C https://t.co/FyxISYXtkv\n\nGot caught up a bit on the way to the assault. https://t.co/LNvJTjb3DS\n\nOperators of FPV drones from the Belarusian Kalinouski Regiment are eliminating enemy infantry, a 120mm mortar, and enemy motor vehicles in the Zaporizhzhia direction. https://t.co/6jH87ckFml\n\nSerbia changed its vote to \"abstained\" in the UN General Assembly on a resolution condemning Russian aggression.\n\n\"Therefore, I believe that we should have voted with restraint, and the responsibility (for the mistake) primarily lies with me. And if anyone needs to apologize, it is me.\" - said the Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nEarlier, the Serbian authorities stated that they initially voted by mistake.\nhttps://t.co/2PkYlL7GN6\n\n@oleshkomyroslav His suit might not be cheap but your propaganda is\n\n\"The Ukrainians have agreed to a ceasefire, and now we will see if we can persuade the Russians to agree to a ceasefire as well.\" - J.D. Vance. https://t.co/J6CmxPq6Sj\n\nFootage of a repeated Russian strike on rescuers during the aftermath of a missile attack in Kryvyi Rih. https://t.co/ivpurOj7Pk\n\n\"We are fighting for our independence. Therefore, we will not recognize any territories occupied by Russia.\" - Zelenskyy. https://t.co/K5bW4Az2MQ\n\nYesterday in Kyiv, a farewell ceremony was held for fallen soldier of the HUR Legion, Dominik \"Tolkien\" Abelen. \n\nThe 28-year-old Dominik was a citizen of New Zealand and a member of the indigenous Māori people. To properly honor the fallen, Dominik Abelen's comrades performed the traditional Māori warrior dance - the \"Haka.\" Eternal memory to the hero.\n\nRussian equipment continues to burn steadily. In the Zaporizhzhia direction, a Russian soldier demonstrates a destroyed Ural truck. https://t.co/uQiNMZLYej\n\nZelensky: \"Our army is using long-range weapons of national production. This is not a show of force; it is a fair response to what Russia is doing. Today, the Russian Federation struck a hotel in Kryvyi Rih. Do you think Ukraine will not respond to this?\"\n\nExcuse me? https://t.co/ZbYMze1yJz\n\nIn the Toretsk direction, soldiers of the 28th Brigade destroyed a column of four \"barn tanks\" with a group of attackers under metal sheets. https://t.co/fFBG18fsfw\n\n\"I have emphasized repeatedly that none of us trust the Russians - we've been through this before. But we will not play along with narratives suggesting that we don't want to end the war. I am very serious about this, and it is crucial for me to end the war. I want the U.S. President to see this, for Europe and everyone to be united in forcing Russia to end the war. That is why my reaction was that we are ready for a 30-day silence format in the way proposed by the American side.\" - Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"If Russia says no, then we will need to analyze everything and determine our place in the world and what they intend to do. If they say 'no,' it will reveal a lot about their goals and intentions.\" - said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nHe also added that the U.S. believes satellites could be used to monitor the ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe medical team of the 63rd Brigade is saving a soldier from the 105th Battalion who sustained severe injuries to his legs, arm, and face from an enemy air-dropped munition. https://t.co/dZdCc1aMNC\n\nWork of the IRIS-T SLM air defense system against a Russian cruise missile by the Air Command \"West\". https://t.co/Laa6dL694o\n\nThe spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Heorhiy Tykhyi, noted that yesterday's negotiations \"were among the most interesting ones I have ever participated in.\"\n\nHe stated that the talks lasted for over eight hours in total - \"almost without interruption, except for lunch, during which work was still ongoing.\" \n\nAlready on the plane after the negotiations, confirmation came from diplomats that \"all processes in Rzeszów had just been resumed.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely to reject the proposed 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine by the United States. Russian sources indicate that any agreement must consider Russia's battlefield achievements and strategic interests.\nhttps://t.co/prfPQoLh0r\n\nAnd so Peskov has now weighed in, saying that it’s best not to 'get ahead of ourselves' when discussing Russia's response to the proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. He added that they first need to receive information from the USA and that a conversation between Putin and Trump could be arranged swiftly, though no agreements have been reached yet.\n\nGirkin-Strelkov on the front line situation—same old story. Russia has achieved nothing beyond minor tactical gains. The Ukrainian forces will withdraw from Sudzha without a fight, hardly a victory for Russia. Once again, Russia is waging war half-heartedly. Classic. https://t.co/N6mrApxVt2\n\nMultiple sources confirm that the supply of military aid and intelligence to Ukraine from the U.S. has resumed following yesterday’s agreements in Jeddah.\n\nRussian propagandist Sladkov will be \"very, very unpleasantly surprised if a truce is reached without our victory\" because Ukraine allegedly always violated truces.\n\nRussia wants peace, you say? https://t.co/NFuvvYMalT\n\nLast night, Ukraine’s defense forces shot down 98 drones from the terrorist federation. Additionally, the enemy launched three ballistic missiles at Kryvyi Rih and Odesa. https://t.co/uuMAGsoO53\n\nSo far, there are no major comments in Russian sources regarding the ceasefire proposal. Radicals, as always, insist on \"fighting to the end,\" while more official channels echo Putin’s claim that peace is impossible without addressing the \"root causes\"—and that Ukraine must withdraw from four partially occupied regions, which, of course, won’t happen.\n\nThat said, Putin can easily point to being \"betrayed\" in the April 2022 negotiations as a reason to stall—though it’s unclear what exactly he’s waiting for. But by morning, Peskov will twitch his moustache, and things will become clearer.\n\nA Russian channel with over a million followers proudly showcases a supposed achievement of the military industry of the \"world's second army\"—a tank encased in a metal box firing haphazardly in indirect fire to \"support\" some kind of \"assault.\" https://t.co/kVEnQbs5K7\n\n\"Everything's computer\"... I must say that Trump and his buddy Putin are completely aligned in their total rejection/misunderstanding of modern technology. Both are absolutely dense dinosaurs. And it’s not about age at all. https://t.co/PI9rxUjs0n\n\nIn Odesa, a Barbados-flagged cargo ship en route to Algeria was hit, reportedly by a Russian Iskander-M missile with a cluster warhead. The vessel, carrying 30,000 tons of wheat, caught fire. Preliminary reports say 4 crew members were killed, 1 injured. https://t.co/BN4Iea95fQ\n\nMajor Russian milbloggers connected to the Kremlin, such as Boris Rozhin, generally do not consider it realistic for the Kremlin to agree to a 30-day ceasefire, calling it a scam/trap. https://t.co/x7Ns9TIfHz\n\nSo what are we thinking, what’s Russia gonna do?\n\nIt seems that Russian war correspondent Alexander Kots is unhappy with the results of the negotiations in Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/kMdv04A03E\n\n\"The best thing Russians can do is simply agree to the Ukrainian side's proposal to cease fire and sit down at the negotiating table.\" - U.S. Secretary of State Rubio.\n\nYermak: Ukraine expressed its willingness to accept the U.S. proposal for the immediate implementation of a temporary 30-day ceasefire, which could be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, provided it is accepted and simultaneously implemented by the Russian Federation. The United States will convey to Russia that reciprocity on its part is key to achieving peace.\n\nThe United States is immediately lifting the pause on intelligence sharing and resuming security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThey cried when they reached the positions of the 3rd Assault Brigade because the occupiers' bunkers were bombed out, their comrades were \"two-hundreded,\" and their own artillery finished off the rest.\nhttps://t.co/uNZ6SLqIXS https://t.co/pJkVq2Tnof\n\nSybiha made a statement about the meeting with the U.S. in Jeddah.\n\n\"We see this meeting as a great opportunity to advance peace and strengthen the Ukrainian-American strategic partnership. The constructive atmosphere proves that we can make the most of this opportunity. Ukraine, more than anyone, seeks peace.\" - said the head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nUkrainian engineers are experimenting with mounting a \"very nasty tactical charge\" on heavy drones. https://t.co/Y2KaRGL8lx\n\nThe massive enemy assault with an armored column was stopped by the fighters of OTU \"Luhansk\" in the Siversk direction. Approximate enemy personnel losses: 159 killed and wounded. https://t.co/XwkekGqIrS\n\nUkrainian media report that the first round of negotiations in Saudi Arabia was dedicated to Ukraine's proposal for a ceasefire at sea and in the sky. \n\nThe delegations also discussed an agreement on rare earth metals. Currently, during the second round - security guarantees are being discussed.\n\nHungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó stated that due to an attack on the infrastructure of the \"Druzhba\" pipeline, oil transportation to Hungary had to be suspended.\n\nHe called the attack \"unacceptable\" and said that Hungary's energy supply is a matter of sovereignty.\n\n\"We urge Ukrainians not to attack the energy infrastructure directed towards Hungary. Hungary is not participating in the war between Russia and Ukraine, and Hungary is not responsible for this war.\" - said Péter Szijjártó.\nhttps://t.co/7kdaha517A\n\nRussian \"Niva\" didn’t quite make it to its destination. But the operator is alive - just a broken nose and a couple of black bags. https://t.co/HXPFdb1V2x\n\nChinese journalists have unexpectedly filmed a report with the Ukrainian Armed Forces for the first time – and even took part in shelling Russian positions.\n\nThis marks the first time that representatives of this media outlet have worked with the Ukrainian army - previously, they had exclusively filmed reports with Russian troops.\n\nAfter more than 3 hours of negotiations, the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations took a break.\n\n\"We are making progress towards our goal.\" - Trump's national security advisor Waltz told reporters regarding the negotiations. https://t.co/K4vVnDMGqJ\n\nAnother confirmation of how \"Russians don't abandon their own.\"\nA Russian soldier finishes off his wounded comrade, who stepped on a mine, with shots to the head from an automatic rifle in the Bakhmut direction. https://t.co/9soBb7AO7F\n\nToday, \"good\" drones paid a visit to the Moscow region.\nThe General Staff confirmed a strike on the Moscow oil refinery, which processes 11 million tons of oil annually and supplies 40-50% of Moscow's diesel and gasoline needs. https://t.co/RNCyVDVwDQ\n\nAmerican podcaster Lex Fridman traveled to Moscow to interview Putin, just as some drones were attacking the city.\nInterestingly, when he was in Ukraine, he didn’t write anything about Russian drone attacks.\n\nIn Yakutia, a folk sculptor created a Statue of Liberty out of manure to foster friendship between the USA and Russia. The plan is to send this artwork to the USA and present it to Trump. https://t.co/0kmS6uxc5G\n\n\"Ceasefire will not happen only through diplomatic gestures. A number of conditions are crucial in advance to ensure that peace - when it comes - is lasting.\" - Yermak. https://t.co/Pl9XcxQbKW\n\n\"Dear Americans, dear Ukrainians, don't miss this chance. Today, the whole world is watching you in Jeddah. Good luck!\" - said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to the delegations of Ukraine and the USA, who are negotiating in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTwo Russian soldiers had a conflict over something, and one shot his fellow serviceman with an assault rifle for unknown reasons - filmed in the Kursk region by aerial reconnaissance of the 61st Brigade. https://t.co/sizXKlVg9e\n\n\"Negotiations with the U.S. team started constructively, we continue our work.\" - Yermak. https://t.co/8ybce6rpA2\n\nPeskov claims that Ukraine has received such a large amount of weaponry that it would last for many months even if supplies were halted.\n\nAdditionally, putin's press secretary suggested that if Musk were to disconnect Ukraine from Starlink, Kyiv's forces would quickly find an alternative.\n\nLast night, multiple regions of Russia, including Moscow, came under one of the largest UAV raids yet, part of a campaign to enforce peace through strength. According to the so-called authorities, over 300 drones were launched, around 100 targeting Moscow and shot down across the city and region. More than 100 were downed in the Kursk region.\n\nVideo: A Miratorg supermarket car park after a UAV was intercepted.\n\nFour more years of this lunacy. https://t.co/CfeglzkBRM\n\nWhile Krasnov spins tall tales about Russia pounding Ukraine, Russian soldiers are blowing themselves up with grenades in groups just to avoid being sent on meat assaults. According to a Russian soldier from Udmurtia, interviewed by Butusov, they’re hiding and gathering in groups to set off grenades, making their injuries look like the result of drone strikes. Better than dying for putin in futile assaults.\n\nThere's a drone threat and air defence activity in Kursk city this night. As usual, the local lot are absolutely thrilled by the spectacle. https://t.co/QhZXo8Kkzb\n\nCrazy how much lying this kethead gets away with\n\nTrump’s a big fan of these faces\n\nPilots of the 5th Separate Assault Brigade, after losing drone in the gray zone, decided to go on a raid to retrieve it.\n\nAs a result, they returned with two captured Russians, an enemy \"Kapushon\" electronic warfare system, three enemy Mavic drones, and four enemy FPV drones. One occupier was eliminated with small arms.\n\nAnother \"road of death,\" littered with burnt Russian equipment. https://t.co/A6ppSmdOKW\n\n\"Spartan\" prevents the enemy from gaining a foothold in the Pokrovsk direction.\n\nAttempts to advance in small groups are a tactic that Russians use daily in the area of responsibility of the 3rd Operational Brigade \"Spartan\" in the Pokrovsk direction. https://t.co/lrw1AJcWHC\n\nU.S. Special Envoy Witkoff stated that Zelensky apologized to Trump after a dispute in the White House.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether Witkoff was referring to a private communication or a public statement by the President of Ukraine, in which he wrote: \"Our meeting in Washington, at the White House, on Friday did not go as planned. It is unfortunate that this happened.\"\n\nZelensky in Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/JUh03iHyOu\n\nRussians built a little hut right in the tree line, directly above the ground.

I'm also very happy we're still able to do this 3 years on. 69th will be in touch with everyone with your rewards.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the United Kingdom promises to transfer the money from the sale of the Chelsea football club to Ukraine. \n\nThe UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that he will “do everything possible” to transfer the frozen 2.3 billion pounds, which Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich received from the sale of the Chelsea football club more than two years ago, to Ukraine.\nhttps://t.co/grkfjNEavq\n\n\"Russia needs a pause in the war to recover its strength. There are all the signs of this.\" - Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the chief intelligence officer, Russians have reached the maximum of their production capacity. Budanov specified that a day of war costs the Russian Federation about $1 billion.\n\nAzov regiment used the new strike UAV \"UAS SETH\".\n\nThe first batch of this Ukrainian-made UAV was delivered to the brigade by \"Come Back Alive\"; the weapon is already deployed in the Toretsk direction.\n\nThe UAV is simple to operate and fully automated. With it, operators will be able to hunt the enemy, their weapons, and equipment even more effectively.\n\nSOF soldiers captured nine occupiers near Pokrovsk using a loudspeaker. https://t.co/syYttLv8OL\n\nThe Kremlin has stated what it expects from the U.S.-Ukraine negotiations in Saudi Arabia.\n\nInteresting, when Russia will start showing that it actually wants this war to end. https://t.co/FrWiAsy4mp\n\nLast night, strike drones attacked the Novokuybyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara region.\n\nThe plant produces fuel for supersonic aircraft and has a design capacity of 8.8 million tons of oil annually. https://t.co/oFy2n0gyVH\n\nToday, Iranian, Chinese, and Russian warships have begun their annual joint drills, Security Belt-2025, showcasing their military ties. These are the fifth joint naval drills conducted by the three countries since 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, commenting on the drills, stated that he is \"not concerned at all\" about the show of force from the three U.S. adversaries. \"We are stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them.\" - he told Fox News.\nhttps://t.co/cOJ3vrqz5E\n\nLast night, unidentified drones once again visited the Novokuybyshevsky oil refinery in the Samara region, where fuel for Russian bombers is produced. The so-called governor of the region stated that the attack failed, but the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations for some reason posted footage of a fire being extinguished at some \"warehouse\" in the city.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has allocated a budget to purchase 4.5 million FPV drones in 2025, significantly exceeding the 1.5 million acquired in 2024. 96% of last year's purchases were from Ukrainian manufacturers, accelerating the industry's growth.\n\nIn 2025, over 110 billion UAH ($2.66 billion) will be spent on drones, with 102 billion allocated through the Defense Procurement Agency. The country's UAV production increased tenfold in January 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.\n\nRussian fools are apparently very proud of their \"Cloaca\" operation. They've even made a poster for the upcoming movie. The world's second-best army, huh. https://t.co/xRe4YfaNdi\n\nPutin's FSB expelled a British diplomat and another's spouse, accusing them of espionage. The FSB claimed the two men deliberately provided false information to enter Russia, violating the law. They were also allegedly engaged in intelligence activities aimed at undermining Russia’s security. This follows the arrest of six Russian proxy spies in the UK, accused of targeting dissidents and sensitive sites, now facing years in prison.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova dismissed reports of a new meeting between Russia and the U.S. in Saudi Arabia this week, despite CNN's claims.\n\nCălin Georgescu, the pro-Russian drama king, threw a fit after Romania’s Central Electoral Commission barred him from the elections, boldly claiming that his exclusion would topple democracy—not just in Romania, but worldwide. By his impeccable reasoning, Europe’s now a dictatorship, and Romania’s groaning under tyranny’s boot. Any day now, he’ll probably anoint himself the final stronghold of liberty.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian taxpayers are gradually catching on to the glaring truth. Their rubles go up in smoke alongside equipment, ammo, and soldiers, merrily morphing into ash and premium fertilizer for the fields. Who could’ve guessed that war doesn’t come with a bargain-bin price tag?\n\nThe Central Electoral Bureau of Romania has disqualified pro-Russian candidate Călin Georgescu from the elections, citing his anti-democratic stance, following complaints, as reported by Bloomberg. Violent unrest erupted in the capital, with Georgescu’s supporters clashing with police forces.\n\nCounter-battery fire from the 44th Artillery Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Russian howitzers: both MLRS and field artillery are used simultaneously. In wartime conditions, hitting guns in cover is extremely difficult without a direct hit. However, this time, the Russians were positioned in the open, which significantly simplified the task.\n\nIt seems like someone is trying to rehabilitate themselves after spouting nonsense while still maintaining their position and refusing to back down from their words. https://t.co/Cz6xaiweHY\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham added, \"Regarding Russia, I would impose sanctions on their banking and energy sectors next week to make them sit at the negotiation table.\"\n\nSenator Graham suggests providing Ukraine with intelligence and weapons until a ceasefire: \"If we cut off Ukraine, it will be worse than Afghanistan. I don't think President Trump wants to do that,\" said the Republican senator. Earlier, it was reported that there is pressure on Trump from members of the Republican Party regarding the restoration of weapons and intelligence supplies to Ukraine.\n\nElon Musk responded to Polish Foreign Minister Sikorski regarding Starlink:\n\n\"Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Secretary of State stated that no one had threatened to disconnect Ukraine from Starlink and advised Sikorski to \"say thank you, because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost the war, and the Russians would be on the border with Poland.\"\n\nCombat group NORD Karjalan ryhmä, fighting for Ukraine with the RDK, shared a photo from the \"Crimea-2\" platform with an M2 Browning .50 HMG. \"Crimea-2\" is a Black Sea drilling rig recaptured by Ukraine’s Armed Forces from Russia in 2023. https://t.co/W9zYwS8A1s\n\nTrump on Zelensky: \"He took American money like candy from a baby... I don't think he's grateful.\" https://t.co/YmZkiXMzNC\n\nTrump said on Fox News: “I got along great with Putin. Putin would be the first one to say this: nobody’s been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. I was tougher on Russia than anybody ever, when you think of it. First of all, there was the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, which was a very bad thing and could’ve led to war. Schiff and all those losers started it. On defense cuts—not now. I’d love to cut defense spending, but not now. There’s China, Russia, a lot of problems now. I’d like to cut nuclear weapons.”\n\nTrump on Ukraine: \"It may not survive in any case.\" This is how he responded to a question about whether Ukraine could survive without U.S. support. \"This war shouldn't have happened, but it did, and now we're stuck in this mess,\" said the U.S. president in an interview with Fox News.\n\nJournalist: Does America treat Ukraine and Israel the same?\nTrump: I believe so, but these are very different places. Different levels of power, different parts of the world. The Middle East has been under constant attack. https://t.co/6no8xIC4iU\n\nElon Musk seems to be struggling with management decisions lately. First, his dealerships fall victim to vandalism, then Trump no longer allows him to directly make government personnel decisions, and now Starlink risks losing $50 million annually due to the instability of its owner.\n\nA Russian soldier is whining that Ukrainians struck his positions with cluster munitions, leaving him with three damaged vehicles. He calls Ukrainians \"fascists\" for hitting the \"good Russian’s\" combat positions. https://t.co/DHoSuIPJRK\n\nIn February, frontline clashes fell by 36%. Pokrovske (1042 clashes, 33.91%) and Kursk (444 clashes, 14.45%) remain the hottest zones. Eastern pressure holds, yet overall activity is waning. https://t.co/UZ2py2NLd3\n\nReports indicate that the US halted maintenance of electronic warfare systems on Ukraine's F-16s. Without updated air defenses, these jets are exposed to Russian missile threats.\n\nTrump, per NBC News, won’t aid Ukraine after the resources deal unless Zelensky agrees to peace with Russia, including territory handover. He also wants elections and possibly the president’s resignation.\n\nhttps://t.co/wurXDT89gn https://t.co/gr6sgpQLHc\n\nUkraine's Defense Forces have destroyed the Russian Tor surface-to-air missile system, designed for air and missile defense at the division level. Exclusive video and photo evidence showcase the successful operation. https://t.co/Vb1lBZPomG\n\nRussian propaganda is frustrated, having to invent new excuses every morning for their failures in repelling Ukrainian attacks on critical economic targets in Russia while trying to cover up the shortcomings of their air defense system. https://t.co/RFKGWSCbBn\n\nTonight, Ukrainian drones attacked the Novolipetsk Metallurgical Plant and the Burevestnik oil refinery in Cheboksary, Russia. Explosions were also heard in Korenevo in the Kursk region, near a distillery in the Voronezh region, at a refinery in Kstovo, and in Ryazan. https://t.co/61elS14jqR\n\nRussians have released footage showing the Ukrainian maritime drone \"Magura-Venom\" launching a smaller drone to target gas extraction platforms in the Black Sea. The attack involved three different modifications of unmanned explosive boats. https://t.co/nVKr5Y9n2M\n\nRussian propaganda’s losing its mind over Trump’s policies, but still can’t help dishing out its signature snark at the West. Does Trump like it? https://t.co/g0dKbJiAFw\n\nWhile Putin is throwing a \"party\" for his troops in Sudzha, Russia’s military-industrial complex has rolled out its latest \"electronic warfare systems\". Complete trust. No analogues. https://t.co/MuQOGi5qhB\n\nCheck out the latest from the 'Russian gas service' on combat duty! They sent the whole squad to unclog the Sudzha pipes – but the Ukrainian Armed Forces upgraded the service with cluster 'plumbers,' and now it’s less gas, more blast! https://t.co/bc5nXd8rGi\n\nBuzzing flying objects were spotted over the cities of Lipetsk and Voronezh in Russia. In Lipetsk, there were at least seven explosions in the sky due to \"air defense activity.\" No videos are available yet. The operation to enforce peace through strength continues.\n\nThe attempt to crawl through a gas pipeline to the outskirts of Sudzha was clearly planned in haste and only very recently. As recently as March 1, the well-known Russian drone operator Moisey was searching for oxygen tanks in the Kursk region and threatening to ban anyone questioning their necessity. While this isn't definitive proof, it raises the question of whether this urgency to counter-attack in Kursk is linked to the broader geopolitical situation and the stance of the current White House administration.\n\nThe situation in the Kursk region looks somewhat concerning overall. It’s clear that the Russians will exaggerate any of their achievements as much as possible. It’s also not worth discussing the feasibility of the operation without an expert understanding of the situation. The fact remains that for eight months, the Russians were unable to dislodge the Defense Forces from this bridgehead, despite using all their best reserves and even sending thousands of North Koreans into battle.\n\nHowever, it would be interesting to understand whether Washington has any hand in the current situation. Who knows, but it seems rather suspiciously close to the recent news about Russians using Western satellites (and Ukrainians being cut off from them) that the Russian counter-offensive began.\n\nRussian channel shares photos of Russian assault troops that were destroyed/suffocated in the gas pipeline in Sudzha, Kursk operational zone. https://t.co/fAbVeB4XOt\n\nRussian assault troops SUFFOCATED in a gas pipe near Sudzha in the Kursk operational zone.\n\nUkraine's airborne assault forces have confirmed that the enemy attempted to use a gas pipeline to establish a foothold on the outskirts of Sudzha in the Kursk operational zone. The Russians themselves had previously claimed this operation was successful. A similar tactic was used by the occupiers in Avdiivka about a year ago.\n\nDespite making it through the sewer, the invaders were promptly detected by defense forces' air recon units and attacked with various types of weaponry, including missiles and artillery. Interestingly, a significant portion of the enemy troops were not just eliminated by fire but literally suffocated. Exact casualty numbers remain unclear.\n\nThe video shows the elimination of a group of neo-Bolsheviks who managed to emerge from the pipe.\n\nRussian Z-bloggers, who were celebrating the unstoppable march of Russian troops toward Sudja this morning and already reporting the city's capture, have deflated like balloons and, as usual, are now trying to find someone to blame for their failures.\n\nThere’s tension in the Rostov region, Russia. Russians are complaining about \"unexplained\" loud sounds and flashes of light in the night sky. Ukrainian UAVs are operating. https://t.co/QUHau8WZbu\n\nThis is what Sudzha looks like today. Russian drone operators filmed a video of the half-destroyed city. https://t.co/QEmUlOeTRi\n\nA Ukrainian MiG-29 crew destroyed a hangar with equipment and a group of Russian troops. Overnight, APCs and IFVs were moved in, but Ukrainian intelligence took note. At dawn, as the Russians prepared their equipment, Ukrainian aviation delivered a precise strike. Kursk direction.\n\nA Russian complains that fighting near Nova Kakhovka, on the Kherson front, is extremely difficult. He says they’re being attacked with everything imaginable—cluster munitions, mortars, drones—claiming it’s the first time he’s ever faced such hell in his life. https://t.co/1KyQve6oQQ\n\nThe Russian Armed Forces have launched a large-scale offensive on all fronts in the Kursk region, announced the honorary TikTok-star of Russia, commander of the \"Ahmat\" special forces, Apti Alaudinov—better late than never. https://t.co/XqD4E5YQcf\n\nA Buryat, rescued from the Zaporizhia front, shows his mutilated comrades. Legless, without a future, and struggling even with prosthetics. He complains that the \"famous\" Russian volunteer aid never reaches the front, as it's looted by officers along the way. Who would doubt it? https://t.co/q0PS6BTdUs\n\nRussians held a masterclass for their \"combat comrades,\" showing them how to surrender gracefully. The soldiers of the 4th Battalion \"Force of Freedom\" of the National Guard of Ukraine \"Ruhbizh\" gladly \"lent a helping hand\" in this educational process. https://t.co/T0BvOXqg7O\n\nThe Atlantic writes that at the current pace, Putin will capture Ukraine only in ~118 years. Due to a lack of resources, Russia can fight for 1–1.5 years without major aid, per ISW analysis of its army, the outlet reports.\n\nhttps://t.co/nwquSbNfYg https://t.co/fv93rLYgfC\n\nWe're 96% done in the fundraiser with € 36,837.06 / € 39,000 collected from 306 amazing people. My heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed. \n\nLet's get this finished: https://t.co/AUOQpOGcel\n\nSome Russian channels do not believe that the cessation of U.S. aid to Ukraine will lead to a collapse of the front, as Ukraine produces the necessary weapons to hold the line, thanks to financial assistance from Europe. They argue that a collapse becomes more likely if Ukrainian society becomes divided.\n\nIn this sense, the Trump administration’s intentions—including talks with the so-called \"opposition\"—become clearer: to fragment Ukrainian society, provoke “elections,” and make it easier for Russia to impose its will.\n\nUkrainian forces thwarted Russia's attempt to break into Sudzha, a move that Z-bloggers had loudly hailed as a \"success,\" claiming the city was already under Russian control. The occupiers attempted to replicate the Avdiivka operation by using underground gas pipeline tunnels, but Ukrainian troops, armed with precise intelligence, set an ambush and destroyed up to 80% of the invading force.\n\nThis is how \"paradise\" looks according to Russian television. The true essence of the \"Russian world\" utopia in a single video—a city, once home to 25,000 people, now reduced to rubble and ash. This is the truly ideological \"paradise\" of the Russians. https://t.co/GtizNnOBZr\n\nSenator Jeff Merkley raised suspicions that Trump could be a Russian agent, citing his promotion of Russian propaganda, halting military aid to Ukraine, and leaking negotiation details before talks even began. In response, Trump supporters simply resort to repeating empty slogans.\n\nOnce again, Russian electronic warfare seemed to doze off — a Ukrainian FPV drone took out a Russian \"UAZ\" vehicle, which was transporting mortar ammunition. https://t.co/zj42Yq8q39\n\nIt seems that ahead of the potential negotiations, Putin realized the critical need to reclaim Sudzha, even though from the outset of the Kursk operation, it was clear how important the captured territory would be for future talks. Russian Z-bloggers are actively pushing reports of Russian forces supposedly storming Sudzha, claiming that the \"elite\" of the Russian army, including the notorious \"Ahmat,\" was sent there—though this group always mysteriously \"disappears\" in the area, somehow \"passing by\" Ukrainian forces without encountering them.\n\nDmitry Medvedev, almost in tears, spoke to a typical Putin-era crowd somewhere in the Kremlin Palace. He blamed the very fact that the Soviet Union had collapsed for triggering the so-called ‘special military operation’ and seemed to warn of the potential disintegration of Russia.\n\nUkrainian Dobropillia, located 30 km from the front line in the Pokrovsk direction. Footage shows Russians using cluster munitions, likely Tornado-S, targeting the civilian city this night. https://t.co/3479kbRj8K\n\nFootage of Ukrainian pilots in action with French Mirage-2000 fighter jets during the repulsion of yesterday's massive Russian missile attack. This marks the first operational use of these aircraft by the Ukrainian Air Force. https://t.co/9tEs7ybiQg\n\nUkrainian drones targeted one of Russia's largest oil refineries, the KINEF plant in the Leningrad region. Russia claims only a tank was damaged. Air defense reported shooting down two drones, with debris causing external damage to the tank. https://t.co/nFpvD0xkL5\n\nAccording to Russian sources, they are bogged down and suffering serious losses in Chasiv Yar due to Ukraine’s significant drone advantage—essentially, they can't even lift their heads. The use of armored vehicles is extremely limited. EW is ineffective due to the rapid adaptation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.\n\nUkrainian soldiers from the reconnaissance special forces company of the 1st Brigade of the National Guard of Ukraine, \"Bureviy,\" are conducting raid operations behind enemy lines in the Kharkiv direction and capturing prisoners. https://t.co/RgsKPoszc3\n\nWhile Russia is \"pounding Ukraine\", according to Trump, things are not so rosy in the real world. See this - a wounded Russian \"veteran\", National Bolshevik no less, with shrapnel in his head and unfit for service due to epilepsy, was detained, deemed fit, and sent to the front. Apparently, he was one of the first scum to be in Sloviansk with Girkin in 2014.\n\nThe Russian military \"Bukhanka,\" which was carrying ammunition, was torn to pieces, along with the EW system, after being hit by a Ukrainian FPV drone. Seems like the EW system took a nap. https://t.co/QDmAKOH5AV\n\nReporter: You mentioned Russia is destroying Ukraine. Why not send air defense to Ukraine?\nTrump: I need to know if they’re willing to negotiate first. https://t.co/6sXbXGbnWr\n\nAt the same time, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed Trump’s threat of new sanctions, claiming that past restrictions have failed to stop Moscow from pursuing its \"objectives\" in Ukraine. As reported, she shared this with CNN.\n\nDuring a press conference, the U.S. president was asked if he believes Putin wants to end the war after Russia's massive strike on Ukraine. He replied, \"I believe, I believe. They're relentlessly bombing Ukraine, but it's harder for me to deal with Ukraine than with Russia — they don't have cards.\"\n\nResponding to a comment about putin bombing Ukraine, Trump says that “anyone would be doing it in his position”.\n\nTrump says he believes Putin who “wants it to stop”.\n\nUnder Ukraine, Donetsk Oblast hosted world-famous performers and the European Football Championship. Under Russia, the only entertainment left for future meat stormtroopers is dressing up in military uniforms and throwing grenades out of a car. Horlivka, so-called “DPR”. https://t.co/44Nk6pzvFX\n\nMeanwhile, in the Russian army, attempting to protect infantry from Ukrainian FPV drones, the Russians decided to develop a homemade portable EW system. It seems, according to their expectations, that it is supposed to protect them from Ukrainian drone attacks. https://t.co/7BkYTOj5uJ\n\nAccording to Axios, Trump is considering imposing tough banking sanctions on Russia because, while he is trying to organize peace talks, the Russians continue to escalate their strikes on Ukraine. Meanwhile, as reported by The Hill, Republicans are calling for the lifting of the ban on arms supplies and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, as the delay in aid could potentially undermine Ukraine's combat readiness and negotiating position.\nhttps://t.co/CSxa77S7gV\nhttps://t.co/YuLjaJqe7q\n\n@MidnightMitch Omg 🤣\n\nTrump suddenly decided it's time to impose heavy banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia after their massive missile attack on Ukraine last night. \"Russia and Ukraine, negotiate now, before it's too late!\" — said the U.S. president. https://t.co/sUm4SMjFjR\n\nIt seems Trump decided that Musk can't just run the government and fire anyone he wants—according to Politico. Now, the billionaire is only allowed to give 'recommendations,' but staffing decisions—that's for the 'real' secretaries. Played around, and that's enough?\nhttps://t.co/vhgna8o4oX\n\nUkrainian FPV drones, launched from a surface drone, targeted and destroyed Russian \"Strela-10\" and \"Osa-AKM\" SAM systems in the Kherson region. The sea-based drone carriers delivered them across the water, and then they took out the Russian equipment deep in their rear! https://t.co/INfzZfpIrd\n\nConcussed Russian soldiers, thrilled to have survived the strike on their vehicle, are filming the wreckage on video. Clearly, they never expected to be lucky enough to escape death, even if only for a short while. https://t.co/BGaxDlW28s\n\nUkraine and the United States will hold negotiations in Jeddah next week, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported. On March 6, Zelensky confirmed the meeting was in the works, and sources from Axios and Fox News previously indicated March 12 as the tentative date. The exact day has not been confirmed yet.\n\nIt seems like the Russians threw in all the leftover equipment they had gathered for the final push on Chasiv Yar. Over 20 units. The assault was repelled, with 16 vehicles either destroyed or damaged. https://t.co/yrFz2kgNOx\n\nThe show goes on! \"Trump promised to end the war in 24 hours, but we didn't say which day exactly,\" quipped Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, live on air. https://t.co/QC3ZQyF0qY"
